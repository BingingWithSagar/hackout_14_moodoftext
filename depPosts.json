It\u2019s not because i\u2019m dumb or the work is hard, not to toot my horn or anything but i think i\u2019m a lil smarter than some. ive just struggled with behavioral issues and mental health all throughout school. this year, i\u2019m actually giving a shit and staying on top of my work but i *cannot* look at my grades. like yea i HAVE to look at them but my grades do not reflect me or how hard i\u2019ve been trying and i feel like everyone at this school is tanking my file on purpose. I go to my 1st period everyday 30 minutes before it even starts so i can finish up early and work on other things, i have honors bio and english, japanese, no PE (because i\u2019m a weak link) and 3 WHOLE electives, one of them being guitar and i actually play in my free time. I have ONE A. *ONE* typing this makes me furious and i want to smash my phone honestly but hey ://. I have 1 A, 1 B, 1 C, 2 D\u2019s and my other two teachers won\u2019t give me my grade yet????? Anything less than an A to me makes me lose my shit. i\u2019m trying, i really am. i\u2019ve been getting up and getting dressed for school everyday, and i wake up at like 4:30. i dont have any friends (personal choice) and i barely even use my phone. i\u2019m trying but my mental health is just worsening by the day it seems. school adds an extra layer of stress my sensitive little mind can\u2019t handle. i know it\u2019s not that deep but for a while, all i got was D\u2019s and F\u2019s because of my behavior. I hate anything less than an A-, i feel so worthless. this is me TRYING and i still manage to present myself as a failure lol. maybe i should\u2019ve tried harder to kill myself in 2017 after all. sorry for the rant.",

            "selftext": "Hey, m16 here.\n\nI have just reached a new low. Most of my friends left my life in the last 3 months, they couldn\u00b4t deal with me changing mentally, I think. I have been toxic towards them, too. But today, the worst thing I could imagine happened. A friend of mine, I really loved her, I cared for her like for nobody else and she cared for me when nobody else did, decided to cut contact with me. She didn\u00b4t tell me why, she just said I should respect her not wanting to text me anymore. I apologized to her about everything I could think of. She didn\u00b4t answer anymore. I have now officially lost all of my friends. I don\u00b4t matter to my parents either. My mum is depressed herself and my dad is mentally abusive, so I won\u00b4t talk to either of them about my depression. I\u00b4ve never felt like the moment she told me she\u00b4d cut contact before. I still feel like vomiting, my heart is deeply aching. She was so incredibly important to me, one of the two person I figured would cry when I died, one of the two reasons I didn\u00b4t kill myself yet. Now she\u00b4s gone. What is holding me back? We all die, don\u00b4t we? What\u00b4s the difference between me dying now, or in 60 years? Why would I want to live on this earth, it is doomed. The past few generations fucked us over. Humanity is going to come to it\u00b4s end soon, why would I want to die along with everyone else, if I can just end it right now?\n\nplease, help",

            "selftext": "I was 19 at the time we started dating, she was my first girlfriend, my first love. Having this girl in my life was the greatest feeling I had ever felt in my life. I've always been a very quiet introvert and didn't have many friends in high school, I had been seriously wanting a relationship for a very long time and I had finally met a girl, an amazing, sweet, caring, beautiful girl. I felt like I was on top of the world knowing I had her. We were such a good fit for each other and it just seemed so right. No matter the day, if we saw each other or not, we were in touch all day long. We both struggle with mental health issues and it really seemed like we were good for each other in regards to that. This past summer, her state took a turn for the worse when she dropped out of school and really started to rethink every little thing in her life. That connection we had seemed like it was starting to fade away. I wasn't hearing from her nearly as much and everything just seemed off; after 8 months she had to end things. It was so hard because we both still loved each other, she just couldn't be/didn't want to be in a relationship right now with everything going on. I felt absolutely gutted and lost. After a couple weeks of being in arguably the worst mental state I had dealt with, things started to look up. We started talking a lot again, we eventually had a conversation about getting back together at some point. We began talking just about every day after that. Well about a week and a half ago those all day long conversations stopped and shortly after I learned that apparently I \"misunderstood\" that conversation about us getting back together and that it would be in a year or so, and that's only if \"its really meant to be\". I am absolutely crushed, she said I needed to focus on moving on now. We haven't contacted each other since then besides wishing her a happy birthday. I've never gone through this before and I really just do not know how to cope with it. It feels like I've lost everything. It felt like I had finally found what I had been missing in my life and now its gone. As selfish as it is, knowing all our friends still get to talk and laugh with her like normal while I can't even hear her voice is fucking killing me. It doesn't feel like these feelings are going to pass for a long time and I don't know what to do. If anyone has read this far down thank you for hearing my vent &lt;3",

            "selftext": "I always have the strongest feeling of being bored. Before I felt like this I had never felt anything close to this. I don't find anything I always spent my time doing fun and it just feels like I'm always wasting my time. The only thing I feel like I won't be bored doing is spending time with friends, specifically one. All I can do when I'm not out with friends is listen to music and stare at a wall or get high. But I know that I really shouldn't be getting high no matter how much better it makes me feel so I've been struggling on not doing it for the past 4 days. I told myself that the only time I can get high is when I'm with friends, because that's when I'm actually enjoying my life. Also something new I've noticed is I'm starting to feel really scared that someone who I want to be best friends with is starting to hate me, even though I've talked to them almost daily for around 6 months. I'm not sure why but I just feel like I'm the most annoying person in the world to them. I don't think they say anything that should make me feel like they don't like me but its almost as if I can feel the emotion behind their texts. But things happen that make me think they do like me, like last night they trusted me enough to log into their social media. But I still feel like I'm just annoying them. I'm not the best of friends with this person but that's something I've really wanted to change and for the past 3 weeks I've been trying to make happen. But I feel like as of recently I'm just annoying and they don't want me to be talking to them. I think it may have to do with them taking a little longer to respond for the past two days but when that thought goes through my brain I realize how crazy it is.",

            "selftext": "I don't see myself as having lived a particularly difficult life, nor do I think I have any insights to share from it. I think I am just sharing this today because there is no viable way for me to speak of it. This part of my past weighs heavy on me. I just want to tell it so the world knows. Anybody really.\n\nWhen I was 15 I tried to kill myself by jumping off a building. I still have the scars from the places where my bones have pierced through my skin. Almost immediately I knew I had survived. I knew I had failed at the one thing in my life I hoped to have done successfully. Turns out killing yourself can be pretty hard. Thousands of unassuming people die as we speak, but me, a girl who wanted to die so badly ended up surviving against all odds. In ways I'm thank-full for it now, but if I'm to be honest, there are often times where I wish I had just died. I know it's ungrateful and I'll never say it. I remember how I made my mom cried the last time I did and my heart twists up in my chest.\n\nRecovery in hospital was hard and easy. In the beginning, the physical pain was excruciating and largely distracted me from the five year long headache of depression and anxiety. For a good while I didn't possess the mobility to use the bathroom, so I wore a diaper at 15. I was also prescribed laxatives for reasons I cannot remember, so long periods of time were spent laying in wet shit until a nurse was there to wipe me. It was completely humiliating. When I was settled into hospital life, I was prescribed large doses of pain meds that made life go quickly, mostly because I slept through most of it. This was the easy part, I was so drugged up I was indifferent to painful thoughts and the physical trauma, and life felt like a hazy dream. The final stage of hospital life, was spent getting my mobility back. Through the support of many physiotherapists and trauma doctors, I was sent home on a wheelchair which I wheeled on for another subsequent 6 months.\n\nThe real painful part though lay in my return back to normal society. I had been so isolated living in the hospital and at home. When I had gained near-full mobility I returned back to my normal societal roles as if nothing had happened. I got a job, went back to high- school, and did all the things normal teenage girls do. Inside though I was struggling bad. A little history here: I have never been formally diagnosed, but I have issues with eating and OCD like thought patterns. I exhibit binge-eating/bulimic eating patterns accompanied by panic attacks. I have never bothered to be formally diagnosed because I didn't see how categorizing my illness might help, but I have been in and out of the mental health system since I was 11.\n\nDuring this time I had started to piece my life together slowly, I am still doing it now. Progress is not linear, there were often times I had fallen into deep anxiety-ridden episodes that lasted days, but even then I re-oriented myself. A lot of the time it was three steps forward, two steps back. At least I was one step ahead. I set small goals, brush my teeth, eat a salad. Most of the goals were centered on not making things worse; don't binge eat tonight, don't drink tonight. I think one would be amazed and the improvements that come from not making things worse. Goals don't always have to be about something you have to do.  The goals were small, sometimes I would only accomplish 50% of my goals for a day. That was okay too, I would try for 51% tommorow.\n\nI am 19 now. I go to school part-time and I don't work. Some of my family in Japan sees me as lazy for this. But I need to prioritize my health so I can be a functional human being for my family and boyfriend, so I'm not sorry. I go to the gym regularly, lead a healthy lifestyle, and my binge/purge anxiety attacks happen one every two weeks. In short, I am much better, although I am still hit by pangs of anxiety and depression, I don't think that part will ever leave me. Most importantly though my life is stable and there are even glimpse moments where I can say I feel happy.\n\nIf you are reading this and want to die as much as I did when I was 15, I won't tell you not to. I won't say life is so much more or that it's selfish. I will say this though, that at this age now I am ultimately happy I didn't die. Choosing to die is a big decision to make, and you owe it to yourself to explore every single avenue of recovery before you end it all. I certainly hadn't when I jumped off that building, most of my friends didn't ever know how sick I was.  And plus, you can always die tomorrow, just post pone it. If you're like me, procrastinating is second nature.  And if you're really set on dying, then might as well do the things you never had the balls to do when you cared about life. Go sky-diving, do something crazy and fun and new. What are the consequences when you're going to die anyways. Maybe you'll discover something along the way that you'll want to keep exploring.\n\nIf you're reading this, I just hope you are okay.",

Im sorry for the rant but I just feel I had so much and to loose it all is just arrgh, there is so much more with trying to get a second job, and dealing with family events( I don't want to even talk about that crap), I just don't know.

            "selftext": "As the title states, I fell in love with my best friend. She's known for a while but I never acted on it. Just over a month ago I decided to take a chance because, you know, people say you'll regret it if you don't. She said no, but we were civil about it. In fact, we were just hanging out playing pool and carried on playing as if nothing happened.\n\nHow did she get me sacked though, you might be wondering? We were colleagues. We met at work but we got on so well and spent every second together thanks to hot-desking. We would hang out after work or on the weekends, even on work nights out we would be a pair. Where one went the other would follow. We would share food, drinks, even popping to the shop would be a be two-person job for us.\n\nSo how did it get to the point where I was sacked? Well, in short, just a lot of bickering started to occur the week after I asked her out. Changes were happening at works we were stressed, petty things we're getting to us. At the end of the following week, during an argument, I mentioned that a few of the girls were glad she rejected me as they believed I was too nice to her, often letting her walk all over me and doing nice things for her without her reciprocating the gestures. Admittedly, I realised they were right and that I was blind. But who hasn't been in a situation where you'd do anything to make someone happy in the hope you earn their love? It's a learning curve. This spiralled into many other petty arguments and bad attitude, avoiding each other, blocking each other on FB Messenger, etc.\n\nNow the lead up to my sacking. The Friday before my sacking, we went on a work night out and decided to patch things up during that day, get some food and drinks with a few other friends of mine before joining up with everyone else. It was more of a leaving due for a few people that had left the company within a month prior to this night - and mine, unknowingly. We were having a good night until she started avoiding me and even gave me a bad look when we were at a club. I didn't know why but I just decided to leave it and get on with my night until I decided to leave early as she made a blatant attempt to upset me by purposely grinding on a mate of mine who I was speaking to at the time. Well, she succeeded at this as I went and sat down after feeling my stomach drop and an ex-colleague of mine put his arm around me to comfort me. He saw the whole thing and knew exactly what I was feeling at that moment in time. I didn't say a single word to him, I just let him speak and about 15 minutes later I left.\n\nMove on to the following Monday, the day I got sacked. My day was normal and time flew by. It hit 12 and I went to lunch. She was in the kitchen her first words to me were, \"what did you say to [ex-colleague]? He told me to stop leading you on.\" I stated I didn't say anything to him but of course, this fell on deaf ears. I decided to leave it at that and take my lunch elsewhere, and of course, I was bombarded with a few messages on FB then blocked (for the thousandth time in a month at this point) before I could even say anything. After lunch, I tried to explain that I said nothing to our ex-colleague but she didn't want to listen and decided to storm off to her meeting early. As she was leaving, I swore under my breath out of pure frustration and sick of not being listened to. It was a moment of stupidity and pure anger. She decided to take that to HR and due to not being part of the workplace for two years, my contract was terminated with immediate effect whereby standard non-contractual disciplinary procedures do not comply. My manager was present and had filed for poor performance, however, in an attempt to defend myself I strongly disagreed with the proof being my recent appraisal stating my performance had met and exceeded all of my manager's expectations. I questioned how my performance could dip in such a short time that it is deemed sackable. This fell on dead ears. In addition to this, I showed the HR manager all of the nasty messages I had received over the past month from my now ex-best friend and how I was being reasonable with my replies. This fell on deaf ears as my friend stated to \"leave her alone\" in our threads despite following those orders up with more text before I could even reply.\n\nNow, I'm unemployed and sick of life in general. I've spoken to a solicitor who has stated I haven't done anything particularly wrong, and that my brief moment of anger should have simply been a slap on the wrist at most. I even showed the solicitor my messages and she was in complete agreement with me and stated I was being hard done by, that I have been treated completely unfairly. However, she couldn't do anything for me due to a minimum of two years of employment is required to file for unfair dismissal or wrongful dismissal, however, as the dismissal was classed as informal the solicitor has stated I can state I left the company due to any reason of my choosing, even mutual agreement, as it is not on my record. She did recommend that I wrote a letter to my previous company though.\n\nNow, it's been two weeks and it's all starting to get to me. I lost my job, my friend, who happens to be the girl I love yet now resent, and I feel stupid because I couldn't keep my mouth shut. All I bloody did was whisper a swear word. Not shout, not pick anything up and throw it, just a bloody whisper. And it's ruining my life. She hasn't even bothered to apologise, she probably doesn't even care. I've had messages from other people saying they miss working with me, how quiet it's been, even my partner in crime (or, in a more dull manner, my partner in accounts) stating she's trying not to feel depressed about the whole situation as she misses me and feels as though I've been treated poorly. Thankfully she's one of the people I can call a real friend, we have plans to see each other soon. But my ex-best friend? Not a word. Judging by her social media, she's actually quite happy and appears to have met a new bloke.\n\nIt's amazing how one person can ruin everything.\n\nEdit: Apologies in advance for any spelling mistakes, I typed this up on my phone. It's also late and I've been on the rum since early in the afternoon. Not much, but enough.",

            "selftext": "I developed essential tremor gradually since I started taking Wellbutrin. I had taken the drug for about 12-18 months. It really helped with my depression and aside from the tremors that slowly developed, I had zero negative side effects. I tapered off Wellbutrin for about a year because things were going well in life and I was self-medicating with coffee and alcohol. While I was off Wellbutrin, the tremor didn't get any better, but didn't get worse either. Coffee and alcohol started losing their positive effects on me, leaving only the negative so I have tapered off both of them and have been totally sober a little over 90 days. But the depression came back so I got back on Wellbutrin, and now that I have, my essential tremor is quickly worsening. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBased on the pattern I described above, I'm worried that the Wellbutrin is doing permanent damage that I won't ever recover from when I stop taking it, which is making it difficult for me to choose to stay on it. Has anyone here had any experience with this? I'm specifically hoping to find stories of people who quit taking the drug and had their essential tremor go away in time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you.",

There were also times that I slept kinda late at night because of studying that I was awaken due to his noise early in the fucking morning and him even getting mad at me for getting mad at him making noise causing me to lose interest in studying because of his dumbass.\n\nI\u2019m severely demotivated and want to study in my home town where my grandparents are. I studied in this town with my dad hoping it would be good but apparently I was wrong and I\u2019m not even sure if I\u2019m making the finals.\n\nI need help making a decision to either lose my sanity and increase my suicidal thoughts by going to school to finish 4weeks in which my psychological health would continue to deteriorate or stop and continue next semester in my new town and find a way to reason with my unreasonable dad.

            "selftext": "Hello, I have come here asking for help with my girlfriend. We have been together for almost a year, we also both struggle with depression and anxiety disorders. At the beginning of this semester she was excited to pick up some classes again at the community college, this made me excited too. Nothing makes me happier than seeing her succeed and be happy. However, halfway through, she stopped attending,  and now has no motivation to go to school at all. \n\nShe has been in a high school extension program for some time, and has had more high school years than any of us would like to. I really want her to be able to get her high school diploma, she has no interest in it because she sees no point in the classes. There hardly is a point to them besides the diploma. But after getting the diploma she can take certificate classes that truly interest her, not just general education. \n\nWe have a couple months left in this semester, and she only has two classes she attends each week. I'm confident that if she were to attend all of them and do the work, she could pass both. If she doesn't this semester, she may be booted from the program, and I am afraid she will not return to school for some time if that happens.\n\nI am willing to help in any way I can. I have offered to do her homework with her, attend the classes with her, etc. I find it's easier to do things we don't like with each other rather than apart. But she always gives the same response, that there is no point.\n\nAny advice would be very helpful. Thank you.",

I don't really know what started it but I started being really down, not being able to sleep and if I did I cried myself to sleep. The only support I had was from her with the biweekly videos she'd make where she'd just ramble about her life and I could just watch her and hear her voice and I'd do the same for her but tried to keep it positive.  \n3 days ago however she put one up instead of today saying it wouldn't be a good one, me not expecting anything and just thinking it was about something that happened to her just went ahead and watched it. By the end of it I just sat behind my pc crying and not knowing what to do anymore. She broke up with me and I basically have no chance of ever getting back with her or even to talk to her ever again. If I do it'll only be if she reached out to me. She gave some reasons and said she made up her mind and no matter what I said she wouldn't change it. \nEach of the last days since then have been a worse struggle then before cause I'm feeling just empty and lost all motivation to even live. I had to put multiple things behind locks just to make sure I wouldn't go back to them to hurt myself with them. \nI don't have anyone anymore, I have no one to go to and the struggles I had only got worse. I have to force myself out of bed, eat, shower, shave and even do anything for my study. I just lost everything I cared about and have no idea what to do anymore. I've had a few suicidal moments and the only thing that stopped me was the thought that she'd find out cause I would've told some mutual friends why I'd be gone forever and she would blame herself for it and maybe get into a worse state then she already is, which I really don't want.",

But I can't stand the way they have behaved lately.\n\nI am socially anxious. I really do not like talking to new people unless they really want to get to know me first.\n\nI used Tinder for a while some months ago to find anything at all. I did find someone special to me. But after seeing each other for a while I don't she is as into me as I am into her. I know she is still using Tinder, even after we've been going out for a while. I don't know what for. I don't wan't out relationship to stop as seeing her is the only thing I am looking forward to. But I have a strong feeling that she will stop seeing me soon. She'll probably try transitioning me as her friend.\n\nI wonder if I should just stop dating. It makes my feelings become like a sine wave. It's complicated. At least I can be happy, but is it worth it if it also makes me sadder than usual?\n\nLately I have been drinking alcoholic beverages more than usual to relieve the stress from the school and my social life. It's been helping me. I know it's not good in the long term. I need to stop this before it becomes a habit.\n\nI am still maintaining a good hygiene and I am keeping my place tidy.\n\nMy family is not that close. We do not share stuff.

All I've done this week is watch television shows and worry, when I should have been studying for my midterms next week. I've come up with endless conspiracy theories of how people are out to get me, but it seems like I've been excommunicated from the group I hung out with last year.\n\nYesterday I realized my jaw is crooked (maybe from a tooth-filling), and today a mucous cyst formed on my lower lip (it's small now, but it's almost visible when my mouth is closed and will grow to be visible, it's going to turn into such a problem...

He tried to get help in the past with therapy/meds but had a bad reaction to adderral and went insane/manic and had to be hospitalized. He has severe trauma since then and a distrust of the medical field. Despite that he got his master's (barely) and is an engineer but seems very blank/distant most of the time. He tried to get his phd but couldn't stand it, dropped out, lived in his car, traveled, camped, skiied and stayed with me for over 6 months mostly focusing on his mental health while I provided for us and supported him until he got a job after 9 months. Fast fwd to now.\n\nI have been sick lately and thinking about how messed up society is (I also have depression and health/spinal issues that make it hard for me to do any activities). While I don't want to commit suicide I feel very at unease in this world and was explaining this to my bf on the phone about to cry and he said the convo was too deep and he was going to make some music. I felt upset and messaged him after saying that I feel really lonely/sad and need support now and he said he can't give it because he's had a shitty week and is too tired. Yet it seems every time I have an issue (which isn't often) he's too tired or stoned to listen. Then he says I just talk for hours \"nonstop\" (which is false... plus he is usually too stoned to engage so yes I do talk more than him but only because he won't ever start a topic). He said he was looking fwd to making music tonight and that he didn't have the energy to focus and had nothing more to say. I just told him good night. Am I being unreasonable or is my bf not being supportive? He blames it on his mental illness and says he has tried for yrs to fix it but can't and why can't I just accept him as he is. I tell him I have been supportive but I also have needs and can't always be on the backburner taking a second seat to his issues.\n\n\\*\\*tl;dr bf's mental health issues always eclipse mine and leaving me feeling unwanted; we are now breaking up and idk if it's the right decision... i care for him but he seems like a shell of a person unable to talk deeply about anything or focus or support me when my times get tough even though i've always been there for him\\*\\*",

After my dad passed away, I moved down to Florida to be with my Sister and brother-in-law, but in August she moved out. Neither of them have talked to me about what happened or why she's gone, but there was a change of address form in the mail, so I'm thinking its more permeant than temporary. Also, the only person that I've become really close to I feel is starting to drift apart because she's started dating(this might just be me projecting tho i dont know. I'm a guy and she's a girl and it might just be in my head)\n\nAnyway, it's becoming harder and harder to cope with everything and I don't know what to do. I feel like everyone I love and care about I lose. I do have a history of depression and self harm, and I have attempted suicide twice in the past, but not for 8 years. I've had ups and downs since then, but this is the most I've had to go through in a while. \n\nI'm so so scared of losing the people that I love. I feel like I don't have a support system left. I just can't stop thinking that I'm ready to die. I can't burdon my friends with this emotional weight becasue its too much and not fair,but i dont know where to turn. maybe i am just ready to die. i dont know what to do",

And I can't fucking figure out why I feel this way, whether it's the stress from work and school combined, my ridiculous family aside from my mom, depression or if I'm just a stupid selfish prick. I'm leaning more towards the latter and it makes me hate myself even more as the days go by. And it isn't always like this, it comes in waves. Sometimes I'll be on top of the world for a few days/weeks/months then out of nowhere I'll hate everything, lose interest in any hobbies, lose almost all motivation for college and want to die for days/weeks/months. Like this whole summer I was kicking ass, saving up money working out every day keeping straight A's didn't miss a day of work and did all kinds of fun shit. That all lasted up until maybe a month or so ago, I started losing sleep stressing about anything imagineable. My temper started getting shorter and I'll get so pissed at myself whenever I slightly mess up something simple my face gets red. I started thinking lowly of myself again. I started isolating myself from my loved ones and 2 only friends (once again besides the gf) started feeling emotionless, indifferent to anything, and have just been stuck in this downward spiral of self hatred and gloom that progressively gets worse every day. And then I started drinking every day again, which seems to be the only way I can get any relaxation or freedom from the fighting in my own mind. For the past 2 weeks I've either been drunk as shit or hungover as shit until I can start drinking again. I actually had to call off work the other day for the first time at this job because I woke up still shit housed. I've cut back since that happened but now I don't get any respite from my thoughts even when I'm at home, it's just non stop \"you're a fucking idiot\" \"you don't deserve the life you have\" \"nobody wants to be around you\" \"why are you such an asshole\" or when I'm driving to or from work \"I should just floor it and drive off this god damn bridge\". I don't know what this is I don't know if you'd even call it depression. I think I'm just the lowest most selfish sack of shit on earth, undeserving of everything I have even though I've broke my back for it and haven't been handed anything besides living rent free, but I still work for that. Eeryone I know thinks I'm super nice and chill and fun to be around, because I hide it so well I guess. I don't talk to anyone about this type of shit except my best friend and he moved half way across the country a few months ago and works nights so I don't get much of a chance to talk to him. So I thought this would be a good place to spill it. This isn't even half of what I want to say but I think I've bitched and moaned enough. Has anyone else ever been in a similar situation? I don't expect any response I just thought it my be good to type this out for some reason. Thanks to anyone who actually read it. If you feel for me for some reason, thanks. If you think I'm a selfish stupid prick that needs to get fucked, thanks I agree.",

I always end back at what seems to be my baseline: I want out of this whole mess. I can improve or change myself dramatically but the world will always be a shit place that makes me feel like shit. I've tried drugs. I've tried being sober. I've tried different spiritual paths/ideas. I've tried medication. I've tried therapy. I've tried exercise. I've tried being super healthy with my diet. At what point does one just give up hope that things will ever be different? I sometimes think that if I lived in a world where I only had to do what I wanted to do each and every day that maybe that would help but no world will ever exist. So almost every single day is filled with things that I don't enjoy and drain any good energy that I might be able to use for enjoyable things. I have ideas from time to time that give me a glimpse of hope but I don't have the time, money, resources, or energy to ever accomplish any of them. So today and most days I feel like I have nothing to look forward to.",

I don\u2019t like people laughing at anything I put or say because it triggers my depression. When my depression gets in the way it causes me to get angry, talk down about myself and I want to believe the things my stepdad says that is not true which I am fat, ugly, retarded even everything he says. The only way I can escape being called names is to move back to the guy who abused me and controlled me better than being in Georgia or even able to put up my stepdad putting me down. Being laughed at is one of my pet peeves and I see people doing that makes me want to go off, cuss and I just say please don\u2019t do that because I don\u2019t like that. People is always going to laugh at me is why I am not going out in public alone, doing anything alone or even doing anything for myself is why I don\u2019t open up because I am afraid of being judged, laughed at, bullied along with everything else. I have social anxiety which I can\u2019t overcome I hate opening up to people even if I don\u2019t know them, I am shy, I don\u2019t know what to say, I blush that I get nervous, my hands shake, my heart races, I breath hard and I don\u2019t like talking out loud so people can hear me because I don\u2019t like the way I look or talk because my depression makes me feel and look like crap. I am just worthless because that is just how people make me feel because I don\u2019t like being laughed at based on my opinion when it was a post saying something that describe my favorite band usually emojis well I get laughed at putting my favorite band using emojis. I know one thing I am not opening up in public until I feel like I should so my mom will have to talk for me because I always been like that and have a fear of opening up because of everything. Nobody talks to me because they don\u2019t understand what I go through or how I feel especially leaving me on read just because I say how I feel then leave me on read without giving me a reason but just tell me your busy instead of ignoring me. Is that too hard to ask if you was a friend to me but when in the first place nobody had nothing to do with me when I moved to him in another state but left and had nothing to do with me because I was getting abused? I am tired of trusting people to the point I get close to them so they can leave and stop talking to me completely even when it is not giving reason. I take being laughed at as bullying which it triggers my depression also I would hate people to bully me because I care what people think of me which I always will because even if it is for people I love. I like people that is not going to laugh at me based on what I say because I have a disability and depression is not nothing to laugh at or about because I don\u2019t laugh at anything anybody says on Facebook which I never use that.",

Is that normal behaviour?I wonder if someone has a family like mine where i do nothing wrong not say one word and someone insults me. My brother likes to tell me that i have down syndrome and keeps calling me a retard and sees me something lower than him. My father is a apathetic drunk who couldn\u2019t care if i would die today or tomorrow. He literally comes in from work and sits on the coach Dosent even socialise with me not even when i was little. I know nothing about my dad and his actual life yet he has lived with me for 19years in the same house as me. my mother only lives with him for money and brags about money all the time she only thinks about money24/7 she has no friends or social life either. Im really depressed i also have no support or mates. Never had a real family. Im just existing in this pile of shit passing time and repeating. my brother dosent even enjoy being around me and whenever im near food he freaks out as if im gross or something btw im clean/tidy. when ever he does interact me he actually takes the piss out of me not having any freinds and makes me very anxious when im around him. I usually try to stay calm and not try to kill myself from it or attack him. Growing up was trash when i was younger i use to get beaten the fuck out of by my older brother for petty stuff like me watching Tv then he would come down and if i said \u201cno\u201d we would get into a massive argument to the point where he would physically attack me and scratch my face. My mum and dad did nothing to stop this. School was even worse. Because i was small and not even tall enough i would always be the one to be picked on and laughed at. If i wanted to have a conversation i was told to \u201cshut the fuck up\u201d if i wanted to express how i felt \u201cshut up\u201d etc this monday coming im going to end myself by hanging ill show pic of where ill hang myself.",

            "selftext": "I\u2019ve had a pretty wonky year with my depression, hit an all time low in April and checked myself into inpatient after planning my suicide, and had a pretty decent high late July going on a solo road trip across the country. Right now I\u2019m stuck at a pretty annoying wall of just not caring about anything.\n\nI\u2019m not sure what\u2019s happened to cause this change, I\u2019ve been on the same dosage/meds since April and havnt had any particular problems since. This whole phase started a couple weeks before my first semester at college started and it\u2019s pretty much only gotten worse since. I have no interest in doing anything at all. I used to hike and camp a lot but I can barely get myself out of my room to go to class even. I don\u2019t even want to waste time playing video games or watching a show. It\u2019s extremely difficult to work on my school work as well. Also I was starting to face difficulties and stress at my job so I left that about the day before my semester started as well.\n\nThis fucking sucks and I really hate it. I\u2019m stuck thinking a lot like \u201cwhy am I even here\u201d, \u201cwhat\u2019s the point\u201d, \u201cif I killed my self in April would the world even be that different today\u201d. I\u2019m not suicidal at the moment but just really really apathetic, almost nihilistic.\n\nI started seeing a new therapist about two weeks ago and really connected right away, but there was a 3 week gap in scheduling due to a vacation/existing appointments they already had so that was the first and most recent time I saw her, my next is several days away. I\u2019m not sure if any of this will be alleviated then so I thought I\u2019d try to find some sort of help on here.",

People say I\u2019m nice, when I think I\u2019m selfish. People say I\u2019m not a burden, I feel like I am. People say I need to give myself more grace and be more patient, I think that I\u2019m lazy and not working hard enough on my issues. \n\nOn the surface, I know I feel this way because of my depression, and that\u2019s easy to rationalize and make peace with. What isn\u2019t so easy, though, is all of the underlying issues and worries and thoughts that fester right into my soul, that other people don\u2019t experience. \n\nAn example: I grew up desperate for any sort of affection, especially physical. My partner is amazing, understanding, patient, kind, and we love each other very deeply. But he isn\u2019t as physically affectionate as I crave. Does this mean we have a bad relationship? Absolutely not, I can\u2019t imagine anyone being a better fit for me than he is. Does that stop me from crying to him about it and making us both sad and feeling guilty and making the relationship feel insecure? Of course not. \n\nI hate that I do this kind of thing- even in the best situation, I\u2019ll find the thing I can be negative about and my brain will zero in on it like a heat-seeking missile, until I try to resolve it and it blows up and creates an issue. It\u2019s exhausting and it\u2019s like I am purposefully sabotaging any happiness that comes my way, dragging others down in the process. \n\nRinse. Repeat. Regret.",

You could call it happier or maybe I'm just trying to put a happier mask on to not show what's going on. Either way I'm definitely more distracted. It's just I don't have that many friends to begin with. And the ones I have aren't really the guys that are into the same movies like I am so you could go to the movies or something like that. I'm just really bad at making new friends because I'm awful at starting a conversation (mostly because I'm just annoying) so it's hard to find people to do that stuff with, because I am sure they're out there. I can be quiet talkative and funny once I get to know someone.\n\nAnyone else with the same problem?",

He told me that he started getting these urges after his girlfriend passed away and it was a way to make him feel attractive. He also said he only feels the need to dress like this when he\u2019s depressed. My brother has had suicidal thoughts before and states he could never go through with it because he is too much of a coward. This still worries me. I asked him if he\u2019s always felt the need to dress this way to perhaps relieve stress but he said no, only recently. I worry he could possibly be spiraling, but then at the same time I don\u2019t want to come off as unsupporting of him if this is how he truly wants to be. I am unsure how to proceed with him mostly because I really worry that this is his last attempt at feeling wanted before he could possibly do something very self destructive.",

            "selftext": "Exactly one week ago I was sitting on my couch, in my empty house, wife and kids gone for the weekend, after I had  just been gone the week prior for work. As I began eating my supper I felt a fluttering sensation in my heart area. I had experienced this before so I continued eating. Not long after I felt the fluttering sensation again. Seconds later I felt it again. Then again, and again. I decided to get in bed for the night as it continued to flutter away. My hope was I\u2019d wake up the next morning and the fluttering would be gone. \n\nThe next morning was more of the same. This had my anxiety and stress levels increasing more and more . I went about my day trying to distract myself from it but to no avail. I of course was riding the wave of the internet reading about the terrible things it could be. I ended up going to bed early again in hopes another nights rest would bring an end to the palpitations. \n\nSunday was a very rough day. Seemed like the frequency of the palpitations was worse than ever. My stress and anxiety was on high level. I couldn\u2019t relax. All I could do was surf the internet and worry about what was wrong with me. My wife came home that evening. I had her take me in to the ER to get checked out. I almost passed out walking in because of how extreme my anxiety was. The hospital took an EKG, X-Ray of my chest, and blood work to check for electrolyte imbalances, thyroid issues, or heart attack. Everything came back clean. While there the monitor would show a premature ventricular contraction every time I would feel a palpitation. They told me I was in no immediate danger and released me. This in no way made me feel any better and my stress and anxiety continued to be maxed out. \n\nThe next morning I called out of work. Told them what was going on and scheduled an appointment with my family doctor for the next day. All awhile not being able to relax because my anxiety was out of control. \n\nMy family doctor decided she didn\u2019t know enough about the heart to tell me whether or not the frequent palpitations were benign or not. She wanted me to make an appointment with Cardiology. She didn\u2019t want to treat the anxiety because she wanted to make sure my heart was healthy enough for the medication. Told me I was in no immediate danger and to return to work the next day. This night was probably the worst emotional night I have ever had in my life. The anxiety and stress had kept me from eating correctly and made me physically exhausted. I haven\u2019t cried in many many years yet I got in bed and had to cry it out for a little while. My poor wife had to take care of our kids and the house by herself because I physically and emotionally couldn\u2019t do it. I had no interest in anything. Felt like I was at a point of no return and that things will never be the same. I felt like I could explode into a million pieces. I ended up going to bed with low expectations of actually going to work the next morning. \n\nSure enough I woke up with the same feeling as before. Felt really tense, on edge, and that there was no fixing me. I typed up an email to my boss and said I wouldn\u2019t be in to work until I went to the Cardiologist this coming Monday. Thankfully my boss is very understanding and said that would be fine and helped me fill out FMLA paperwork. I ended up forcing myself to do chores around the house this day. I went for a walk to the post office, and picked up my kids. I was really impressed with how much better I was feeling. I wasn\u2019t all the way back but I was starting to have a little bit more hope. I ended up calling a Psychiatrist office to set up an appointment the next day. Was told they were only accepting patients for therapy and nothing else. Figured it couldn\u2019t hurt so I planned on going the next day. The rest of the night went seemingly well and felt confident things were on the up. \n\nYesterday morning I woke up and was feeling a bit anxious but nothing as bad. I went to the therapy office in hopes it would help. Ended up not being what I expected and was just a screening to see if I needed therapy or not. The lady agreed I did and set an appointment up 2 weeks out. I was still feeling somewhat okay and went home and did more chores around the house. I had picked the kids up and started doing the dishes. Was getting close time for my wife to get home and started feeling terrible again. Was feeling very emotional, sweaty, sad, hopeless, nauseated etc. Needless to say this a huge morale killer and I had felt like I was going back in to the slump again. Not even 30 mins later I began feeling normal again and ended up having a pretty good evening. \n\nThis morning was a very good morning. Felt pretty much normal and headed out to drop an FMLA form off at my doctors office. This afternoon has been pretty good too but I sometimes get these waves of sadness, despair, and worry. As I write this post out I don\u2019t even feel the greatest. It feels like my emotions are very fragile and the balance beam keeps swaying between normal and depression. I just want this feeling to go away and stay away. \n\nI apologize for such a wall of text. Not even sure what my goal here was. Just needed to vent and tell everyone my story. I\u2019m honestly not even positive if I\u2019m suffering more from anxiety or depression. It seems like both to me. It\u2019s to the point now where I don\u2019t even care about my heart palpitations and I\u2019m only worried about my emotions. It\u2019s been draining not only emotionally but physically as well. I do have a few questions for you guys if you don\u2019t mind. \n\n1. Is it normal to haves these waves of emotions like this? I guess it\u2019s really mood swings. But I don\u2019t go from really happy to really sad. I just go from feeling normal to feeling depressed/anxious. \n\n2. My biggest worry is if my Cardiologist gives my family Dr the go ahead to treat this, what am I going to do the weeks it takes for the medicine to really kick in? I can\u2019t go 6 weeks feeling so fragile. I have to go back to work so it\u2019s not like I can just wait around for them to start working. Is there any other meds that can be used as a bridge till when the long term meds kick in? \n\n3. I don\u2019t think this emotional instability is what caused my heart palpitations but does anyone else have experience with very frequent premature ventricular contractions that last for over a week? I literally have hundreds of them a day. \n\nThis post is such a mess. I apologize. I just need someone to talk to about this. My wife tries to compare her depression to what I\u2019m going through. Basically saying I just need to suck it up and push through. I know she means well but it isn\u2019t really helping. But maybe she is right, maybe I\u2019m just being a big pussy.",

I go a month or two without bathing/showering and when the dead skin cells starts to build up and get flaky I fill the bathtub up and spend hours scrubbing it all off. No soap or anything. Just water, loofahs, and exfoliating brushes. I do this till the water gets filthy. I drain it and do it all again until the water is completely clear and there's nothing left to scrub off. My skin is raw and baby soft by the time I'm done. And I think to myself I can feel like this everyday if just did it regularly. I make the resolution to shower everyday, but before I know it I'm back in the same spot. The only time I can stand to clean myself is when I'm backed into a corner and about to cross the line into absolutely filthy. At which point people will notice. The shame and guilt of that is why I clean myself at all. The only reason people haven't noticed is because I wipe myself down with baby wipes everyday. And I always wash my face and brush my teeth. Sometimes I think if I didn't have to interact with other human beings I would just rot in my own filth.\n\nNo one in my life knows about this. I live alone. I grew up Muslim and I'm female so I'm always covered head to toe. I stopped believing in anything a long time ago but I still cover up because of this issue. I can't even bring myself to tell my therapist. I just don't know what to do.",

Fortunately I am now in a position where I don't have to deal with depression on a day to day bases but it still rears its ugly head.   \nAll through elementary/middle i was bullied and such and thus got into this state. WIth that and some home issues as you can figure I was in a horrible state. One of the ways that help me push through all that was to set a goal. Be it small or large.   \nI set goals for needing to watch the next episode of a show or anime, set a goal for hanging out with a friend. Knowing that I had these goals helped me push through it.  Even now where I am in a much happier state I still do this when uni or something else is just crushing me. For example when i plan outings I use that and now I have a trip for Japan that hopefully happens next year. This has been something that I have planned for years now and honestly has helped me push through several dark times.   \nI know of a couple people that have done this bu personally for me goals that i have set has been an anchor and keep me going.",

That's not even two weeks travel. I'm already not eating to save money. I lost almost all the weight I gained in ED recovery in just three weeks from not eating to save money for travel. I genuinely don't want to live anymore. I'm always going to be stuck with no qualifications just because I can't afford to travel to school. If my boss wouldn't pay me 3x less the industry standard for my work, this wouldn't be an issue. I just don't see the point in living anymore.

This school is even worse, some people is laughing about my character (I think I'm different). Everyone has made friends, but I don't. I have got on well only with one girl, but I think she doesn't want me so much. I have only online friends so I'm spending almost from 10 to 15 hours a day trying to talk to somebody and watching useless videos on YouTube. I wanted to learn programming, but I'm to lazy, I always say I will start tommorow. Now I think I'm addicted to phone and computer. I want terseness but no one can give me that. I know that some people have worse problems than me, but I don't want to live like that anymore.

I'm a sophomore at the University of Toledo for electrical engineering because, call me a psycho, but I'm very \"go big or go home\" kind of person, and I won't settle on a career path if I'm not gonna make a ton of money doing it. Also because I got a full ride so I felt like it was the obvious path. Lately I've realized that I hate what I'm doing partly because the stress of all of my classes is too much (physics and calculus 2 are nigh impossible for me) and partly because the idea of being an engineer sounds soul crushing outside of the fat loot I'd be making. \n\nMy real interest lies in music. I'd love to become a musician that can write something to speaks to people and brightens their day or lets them know that they aren't the only people that feel a certain way. Only problem with that is I know I couldn't do it. I could theoretically settle for some job that I don't need to go to college for but I'm worried about living my life impoverished because I couldn't make that push due to the crushing weight of depression and anxiety killing my motivation even when my brain is screaming at me to get my work done.\n\n I just have no clue wether I want to take the Gamble and follow my dream even if it means I could be living under a bridge or just tank through the schoolwork even though it drives me to suicide.\n\nI don't really expect a life changing answer on here, but any help is appreciated. I just kind of wanted to vent my personal concerns and this seems like a decent place for it.\n\nPeace dudes, stay strong \ud83d\udc4a",

The worst part? I'm only in 8th grade.\n\n I walked in school today and felt the lonliest i've ever felt before. I sat by myself in the corner of the courtyard, just waiting for the bell to ring. I saw other people being happy and talking and joking around and it almost made me cry.\n\n I have \"friends\" But they are just people I hang with because I'm afraid to leave them or I'm forced to be in the same class as them. I don't like being with them. I feel like I can't have a actual conversation with a single one of them. Plus., social anxiety kicks me right in the gut if anyone actually nice and caring wants to talk to me. I want to keep the people who actually want to talk around and it gives me anxiety and I end up looking stupid and wierd. \n\nSo yeah, I was right about loosing all my friends, it just happened earlier than I thought it would.",

And afterwards I sat down and did nothing and slowly felt worse and worse about it. I thought about how in a psychiatric hospital I would have no choice but to do nothing, and that almost sounded comforting... Then I did 20 sit-ups and cried on the floor for 10 minutes, which was weird. So, my question is: What do you guys do when you aren't able to motivate yourself to do anything, but the thought of doing nothing makes you feel worse?",

I try to be honest and say what I think but it's not felt. I keep it all inside and I've shared in the past with psychologists but it's not felt, it's categorized and deduced. \"I know what you're going through, you're on the right track, I've been through the same, it's possible\". How can you know that when you don't touch my thoughts? I slit my wrists when someone tells me that because the alternative is hurting you. I am angry at you for saying that but I don't want to hurt you, so I need it to be my fault. \n\nI've been told I have a golden heart and that I convey warmth and kindness but I wish I didn't. I search for events in my life to corrupt this morality because it brings me nothing but decay.",

            "selftext": "Last month, I made a huge decision of withdrawing from my Education program at uni. I realized I really didn\u2019t want to pursue teaching as a long term career and didn\u2019t see the point in doing a whole degree on it. I kept trying to convince myself that I don\u2019t have to teach afterwards, but I was dreading all the practicums I would have to do for the next 2 years. I thought the children I will be teaching do not deserve that. Going to my classes where it was mostly discussion based and having to constantly spew bs on how inspired I was to become a teacher was making me sick to my stomach.\n\nI didn\u2019t necessarily drop out of the university but I withdrew from all my classes this semester. That did give me some relief, as I didn\u2019t have to worry about the workload anymore. But then I started feeling lost because for the last 2 years, Education was all I\u2019ve been working towards. \n\nI don\u2019t really know exactly what kind of career I want to pursue anymore. Growing up, I didn\u2019t really have a certain traditional occupation I wanted to do unlike my peers who would say they want to be a dentist, accountant, engineer, etc. Honestly, I went into Education not thinking it was what I wanted to pursue long term. But I have my interests and hobbies on the side, like content creating (a YouTube channel with 11k subscribers for example but I create content for other websites too).\n\nI do have an intention of going back in January, just no longer taking Education classes. I\u2019ve applied for a \u201cbroader\u201d kind of major that I\u2019m sure I will enjoy at least for the most part. With this major, all the classes I\u2019ve put time and money on for the past 2 years won\u2019t go to waste. However, the job prospects is making me worry. That seems to be a big problem of mine, unnecessarily worrying about the future too much. \u201cWhat if this happens, what if that happens\u201d, etc. \n\nWhen this starts happening, I find myself wanting to just hide in my bed. For the past few weeks I\u2019ve been sleeping a whole lot. Actually, I would stay up until nearly dawn because I didn\u2019t wanna close my eyes knowing I\u2019ll wake up and have to face tomorrow again. There would also be times when I\u2019m just eating, and my emotions would start eating me up and I would start crying. Due to my overthinking, I\u2019ve also been finding it hard to enjoy things I used to enjoy. There have been some good days when I could watch videos and laugh (usually during those times after midnight when I\u2019m still up). I don\u2019t have self harming tendencies but I find myself constantly wishing I could disappear and just be forgotten so I can stop being a burden to my family and friends. Whenever I wake up (in the afternoon nowadays), my heart would immediately start racing and I just feel overall shitty for having to live another day. I do find myself start feeling better as I go about my day but it all goes back to 0 when I wake up the next day. \n\nNot to mention the fact that I can\u2019t stop comparing myself to my peers either. Some of them are so close to becoming accountants, nurses, engineers, and I\u2019m just...... me. Growing up I\u2019ve always done well academically so no one including me would have ever thought I\u2019d be this way in college. \n\nSo yeah, that was a ramble. I don\u2019t want to self-diagnose but I\u2019ve just been going through so much lately :( I do have friends to vent to but sometimes strangers are better to open up to.",

            "selftext": "And I\u2019m still alone. I\u2019m a very introverted person, so naturally, socializing with new people is a difficult task for me. But I told myself when I first moved away to college, that I was going to be positive and try my hardest. Every attempt at making friends has been a fail for me. And I\u2019ve tried many times.\n\nThe first one was a girl I met during the big Freshmen photo my college takes every year. We got stuck behind a bunch of tall guys, so we joked about being short. She gave me her Snapchat and we talked for a little bit. I asked her to hang out with me at a party one night, and she agreed. I had fun and we talked a lot about ourselves. It was super nice, and I thought I had made good progress on making my first friend. But then, I tried a few days later to have lunch with her. She said she was busy and asked for a rain check. I tried again a few other times and she always came up with an excuse to not hang out with me. So I just dropped it, and that became my first failure.\n\nThe second one was a church group. I\u2019m religious, so it was important for me to find a group of people I could worship with sometimes. I started going to youth groups and worship nights, but I noticed nobody would come up and talk to me. I tried initiating the conversation, but it was always awkward and I felt like they were forcing themselves to talk to me. But I tried to be positive, so I kept going. I saw these people 3 times a week for over a month, and nobody talked to me unless I started the conversation. I signed up for their retreat, having high hopes that it would make the bonding part easier on me, but I was wrong. The entire first night, I sat alone after many attempts at joining games or conversations. One time in particular bothers me. A group of girls was sitting at a table, and since I was alone, I went up to them and tried joining the conversation. After a few minutes, like 2-3, of me sitting there, the entire group got up and moved to a different area of the dining hall. So after the first day and that incident, I called my mom to come pick me up and I left. I was miserable, and it felt like middle school was happening all over again. That was fail number 2.\n\nThe third was with a group of friends I made in my Spanish course. There were four of us, and we all got along well in class. One day, the guy and one of the 2 girls asked me to go to lunch with them, just the 3 of us. I was excited, so I agreed. We chatted on the way there, but when we sat down to eat, they both ignored me. They talked about all of these things that I couldn\u2019t relate to and I felt super uncomfortable by the end of it. But I stayed until we were all done eating, and said goodbye to them when we separated. Now, I see all three of them hanging out without me and it\u2019s really awkward in class when I try to speak to them.\n\nAnd lastly, fail number four is currently happening with this very small sorority I joined. When I say small, I mean 7 of us total. I went to the first info meeting because my mom begged me to after I told her I had faced many other failed attempts at making friends. The info meeting was super awkward, but I thought I would try again. I went to a second and third meeting, and they were pretty good. Then I had my interview for joining, and I really felt like I belonged! After that, we had bid night. They took the other new recruit and I out to dinner. It was fun for a little bit, but I felt left out for a majority of the evening. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because I do it to myself naturally or what, but I\u2019m always the odd person out. Especially with an odd number of people. So now I\u2019m debating what to do, since I\u2019ve already bid to that sorority. I don\u2019t know if I should continue going or not. \n\nAfter writing these out to post, I\u2019ve noticed that I\u2019m obviously the problem in all of these situations. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing that is so repellent to others, but it must be something unbearable. I\u2019m really struggling to keep going, and it\u2019s getting harder for me to want to go anywhere. I hate this feeling so much but I\u2019m constantly thrown back into it. It took me so long to like myself and be socially confident in high school, but now I feel like I\u2019m starting all over. I don\u2019t know what to do anymore.",

            "selftext": "She's 17, my mother has *narcissistic personality disorder* and father has gotten into a romance with my cousin's ex-wife looking after her kids. Father is probably psychopathic or suffers a personality disorder himself since he's devoid of empathy. Or it could just be that he's 75 years old.\n\nFinancially she's taken care of, and lives in her own apartment *(in father's name\\*)* where my mother and my step-father take turns on living with her as they divorced 3 years ago. They provide zero emotional comfort and she doesn't really see any choice of being with either of them as my mother has temper tantrums, and doesn't feel any connections to my step-father as he's getting old, and furious that he's taking care of my mother's step-children.\n\nThey're pretty neglectful and careless in terms of her emotional well-being, and she was close to being taken into a foster home during this spring.. That ended abruptly as father took a sharp lawyer who basically shut that process.\n\nPretty bizarre given that our family has ***considerable*** wealth, and goes to show money doesn't equate to happiness. \n\nFast-forward, I am currently abroad, and won't be back until January, and I am seeing that she's becoming more and more isolated. \n\nShe has stopped going to school and my mother is becoming increasingly worried - me too. She sleeps through most of the day. Issue is that parents don't understand that she's feeling the way she is feeling ***due*** to them. A private psychiatrist even said that my mother can traumatise people with words.\n\nI try to talk to her as much as possible, being patient, loving and everything but she is just progressing to becoming more and more isolated. \n\n*\" I just don't want to talk to anyone \"* is what she says.\n\nShe's regularly in touch with a therapist, whom she feels a therapeutic alliance with, and will see on Wednesday.\n\nI have experience with depression myself, due to our fucked-up family dynamics but I have gotten out of it with a rigorous hardcore diet, and mindfulness.. And also not being in touch with them as I am an adult.\n\nI put her early on on EPA &amp; DHA omega 3 fatty acids, 1.5G of each every day as I saw that she was at risk of slipping into depression. She's also on a probiotic that is as efficacious as citalopram *(lactobacillus helveticus NS8\\*).* But she seems to have gotten into a circle where she occasionally eats them and sleeps mostly.\n\nI also suggested that she starts to play tennis *(she's got a natural talent for it\\*)* in order to increase the amount of circle of friends that aren't related to school *(she has social anxiety, which I also had at that age, but could handle\\*).*\n\nI am NC with my parents as my PTSD flares up, they're like oceanic waves who just ruin that castle you build on the beach. But this is getting so concerned that I am thinking of talking with my step-father and perhaps living with her in her apartment.\n\nSimultaneously I don't really see that I can take care of her, and risk further damaging my mental-health as I'll regularly see these two freaks of parents if I live with her. I feel like the guy who reaches out and gives a hand to the person drowning in ice, you risk being pulled in.\n\nI don't know what the fuck to do.   \nFor the love of life help.",

Since switching from mood stabilizers to anti-depressants, I've been significantly more depressed. I tell my doctor that I felt better and actually had a life when I was on mood-stabilizers but because of my \"suicide attempt\" (wasn't trying to die, was just being reckless) this past February, he doesn't want to prescribe them anymore. I'm now on an SNRI and I sleep all day. I'm at risk at failing most of my classes this semester. It suppresses my appetite so much that the other day I fainted because I hadn't eaten in 2 days. I don't know why he wont listen to me. I'm now a danger to myself and a burden to those who care about me. What can I do? I know this medication isn't right for me but my doctor wont listen. :(",

After coming home I went straight to bed and cried for a little bit (nothing unusual sadly) but afterwards I kept thinking about who I am as a person and realized that I have no fucking personality or hobbies or will to do anything.\n\nMore and more it\u2019s feeling like I\u2019m just going through the motions to get through my day rather than actually trying anything except I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m even looking forward to, I\u2019m just mindlessly existing. It bothers me that other people have such character and are plain fun to be around and I\u2019m just like this; I\u2019m not necessarily complaining about being lonely right now but more so about how I don\u2019t have a personality and I have no clue how to make one for myself.\n\nI get the feeling if I told anybody about this in real life they\u2019d tell me to go get out there and make friends and find out what I like but I have no drive to do anything right now except maybe play video games.\n\nThere\u2019s a ton more issues about self doubt and image that I have but I don\u2019t want this post to turn into any more of a text wall than it already is.

A year later and I thought things were ok, boss never truly complained about my performance but today was told that I've been in the same job position for 3 years as a junior developer and that if things don't improve in 2 months that I should consider looking for a new position within the company and that I could talk to the director of development to see if another role would suit me.\n\nI was already wanting to quit the job but this really just makes me feel worthless since I've been through so much already where every day is stressful and I really try to do good. Its my dream job and for the past 3 years I've had my dream shattered after the first month here when I couldn't socialize with coworkers (I have Asperger's). I've cried many times on the way home from the times I have been told I'm not doing well performance-wise since I really try.\n\nI don't know what to do. My life has ballooned in expenses and bills and things that I can't just pick up a different lower paying job without losing all of it from a very very quick snowball effect that'd happen if I even missed one payment on something let along having half of my monthly income going straight towards rent.",

Not that anyone else would care, Ive been left to be alone mostly for the last three months outside of work. The only person to care, was my S/O.

There\u2019s always another choice. Seek counseling and therapy, remove the fear of being shamed from your mind because mental illness is an illness the same as cancer, emphysema, etc.",

            "selftext": "I have been hospitalized twice before when I had insurance. I didn\u2019t have any kinds of issues.  A few weeks ago I went to the same hospital to try to get help. I told them this time I have no insurance. I ended up waiting over two hours and at that point I was starving. I told them I\u2019d leave to grab food and come right back. Was rudely told by the receptionist that if I left it would be even longer and that \u201cI told you it might be a while because you didn\u2019t have an appointment\u201d. I literally saw people there for thirty minutes go back. So I just went back home defeated. So fast forward to this week and I go to a mental health clinic near by. Was told that since I am unemployed and have no insurance it would cost me $89 per 30 minute session and no financial help is available to me unless I had a job, which I\u2019m trying desperately to get. \n\nToday I\u2019ve finally had enough and decided to call the hospital I walked in last week and get an appointment this time. I was told since I have no insurance, I\u2019d have to make a $6,000 down payment. I told the lady I literally have 15cents in my bank account and no job. She was really rude about it when I told them that they basically can\u2019t help me because I have no insurance and no money. I ended up telling her I\u2019ll commit suicide instead and hung up. They sent the cops to my house to check up on me. I told them I was fine and I\u2019d find another hospital. \nI just want to know how in the hell am I supposed to get help when everyone has been treating me like this because I don\u2019t have insurance? I thought they couldn\u2019t turn away medical treatment if you don\u2019t have insurance?",

What motivates you daily? What stupid sentences really make you think and hit home with inspiration or motivation? What makes you want to better yourself? Just what keeps you going. Anything, literally anything even if you think it's pathetic. Let me know. \n\nI've always been majorly depressed and all that shit throughout life so none of this is new for me. I always try and make myself keep pushing on regardless of the situation, trying to find light in impossible times and so on. But there's those moments when you feel quite hollow and like the depression is trying to wither every bit of me away and knock me down.\n I just moved to another country for a year. As expected, the complete and utter depression is trying to drag me into its hold once again. This happens regardless of the situation so I knew it was coming - it's just fucking frustrating when I want to be having the time of my life, making friends, exploring, learning, bettering myself - but all I want to do is isolate myself and live out this one alone in my bed. Not the best idea I know. But it's intensely difficult to convince myself otherwise at the best of times never mind exist without the constant intrusive thoughts of hurting myself etc. Then my brain just tries to turn everyone and everything I love against me.\n\nIt's a shitshow - I'm aware of the irrationalities of this but it doesn't make it any less prevalent.\n\nSo refer back to the top paragraph, and let me know what the fuck gets you out of bed.\n\nThanks n big love",

Money they didn't loose or harm that was not caused all while she was sitting in the car calling my mother mom. Mean while I've been thrown into an asylum and locked away because the grief and pain and suffering these pair have caused me is beyond repair. Its going to take years to MAYBE fix. Its bad enough that I still wish my life would end today. I cant even stand being in the same court room let alone be around her...

Saturday I had major anxiety and couldn\u2019t get out of bed until the afternoon and that always bothers him so he was cold again. And Sunday I tried to be normal but he was being distant and said he just needed some space and it\u2019s be fine so I went home. Then Tuesday he wasn\u2019t feeling well and was being real nice again. Wednesday I wanted him to come to therapy but he didn\u2019t want to and that kind of turned into a fight and he ended up spending the day with some of his friends which is good for him. When he was driving home that night we spoke on the phone and he said he wanted to break up but I said no because last week we were talking about getting married and having kids. Said I knew we had a rough week but we\u2019ll get through it and go to therapy and work on it. Said he\u2019s not interested in arguing anymore and it\u2019s too exhausting. Then said I need a job so we can move in together...? And said he needs some space. I called him yesterday trying to be normal and positive and he was mostly uninterested in talking to me. How could he go from loving me to being indifferent so fast?",

Even when I think I do well in an interview I never hear anything back, which probably means I didn't do as well as I thought I did. I do some stuff for my mom as some sort of minor repayment for giving me food and a place to stay. Also do some stuff, mostly yardwork, for neighbors so I have a tiny bit of money.

WTF is wrong with people I hate working retail and customer support; people come in acting like complete cunts. I\u2019ve had a really tough week with my depression and this guy just made it so much worse, it\u2019s a Friday and you\u2019ve completely drained my social battery and I\u2019ll end up staying the weekend in my basement all alone making my depression way worse because I can\u2019t be out in public. \n\nI want to cry right now.",

It was a small town that was a road long and we hated it.\n\nMy brother is in the marines and is stationed in NC. Well, his wife left him and he was drowning in debt and was drinking everyday. He asked us to move out there to help him. We got interviews lined up before leaving and we took out some loans just to be on the safe side and we left. \n\nOnce we got to NC, we found a great job. It was awesome. My boss told us though the job was seasonal it would last until November. Then Hurricane Dorian came and we were going to leave just to be on the safe side. We knew if we left we wouldn\u2019t have the means to come back but at least we had enough savings to get somewhere and hold us down until we could find another job.  My boss convinced us to stay so we did. The job ended 3 days after the hurricane and my husband and I couldn\u2019t find another job. Our funds are completely gone.\n\nWe made the dreaded decision to come home where our family is so they could help us. Our goal was to become team drivers (my husband and I) so we could get out of the hole we were in. I just got hired by a trucking company but no company will hire my husband because he hasn\u2019t had his regular Driver\u2019s License long enough. I\u2019m leaving Oct 21 and I\u2019m scared of going alone just because I\u2019m a female and for some reason I\u2019m a magnet for trouble (I\u2019ve been sexually abused a lot and it seems like I have a sign on my forehead that says \u201cDo it again.\u201d) We won\u2019t have enough money to pay our bills this month and I\u2019m absolutely terrified. \n\nYesterday I took the DOT physical and I need to go get my CDL permit on Monday. I know everything will get better once I go but I\u2019m so scared and going through this has been terrible. \n\nThank you for letting me share.",

It is hell trying to even get one but once I do the real battle of trying to keep it begins. I have nothing to say to my coworkers and I\u2019m just that quiet awkward  guy keeping to himself all day without talking to anyone. This gets me into trouble a lot of times because stupid management hates that I\u2019m not a clown trying really hard to sell shit to people and pretending to be someone I\u2019m not.

But my depression is ruining my relationships and the pain of knowing what I\u2019m doing to those relationships is playing into the depression horribly. My mind seems to have a will of its own and is a constant thorn in my side. The logic side of me understands the right steps to take but the depression overwhelms that voice.

I told her I loved her and she told me the same. For the past week we have spent every day together and we fall asleep together and it\u2019s honestly been like something out of a dream. \n\nI recently have become frustrated with the lack of intimacy (see \u201csucking and fucking) and we had a bit of a falling out.\n\nTurns out she has been trying to go fuck other dudes because it\u2019s \u201cexciting\u201d and last night almost left in the early hours of the morning to go fuck a guy for some coke. Good shit. I am clearly a pathetic loser to tie my horse to such a wagon. I have nowhere to live currently. \n\nI hit up a few friends to see if they would have some space for me while I attempted to get on my feet but was rebuffed literally every time lol.\n\nSo now I am stuck living with a girl that I have very real feelings for while she chats with dudes on Tinder and \u201cgoes to her friends house really quick\u201d while I sit here and drink myself to sleep because it does not come normally.\n\nAll of my guitars are in the pawn shop. Everyone I have ever loved has shit on me and laughed about it. I work at a shitty restaurant and have no real future. The only thing that made my days better before this girl was a bag filled with a substance that shared the color of her skin.\n\nBoys this is embarrassing. I made a fool of myself last night. This girl wants nothing to do with me anymore and to be honest I feel the same way.\n\nI just hate feeling like I wasn\u2019t enough. Never have been. For anyone. I wish my friends would call me back. I wish I could just pick up my acoustic and play for a bit. Wish I could be happy for just a few minutes. I wish it didn\u2019t have to be like this. I wish I had the resolve to off myself.\n\nBut for now I have some 4Lokos and some Mexican food from the gas station that I always thought was trash but is actually pretty dank. This will get me through the next few hours I think. \n\nUntil she leaves. Until my phone doesn\u2019t ring. Until the sun goes down and the only light left in my life comes from this little box I\u2019m typing this on.\n\nHow the fuck am I supposed to get by lol?\n\nBeing told to your face that you suck and you\u2019re not good enough by someone you love is a doozy my dudes. Mom did it first and then everyone after that. \n\nBut yeah Happy Friday my guys.",

If some of you guys do, what kind of Stories/Vision's that you make inside of your heads? Either they all could run like a  Movie,  Video game, Tv series, Anime, Comic, Manga,  Cartoon, Novel, ect.\n\nFor me mine's run like comics cause I'll officially be getting a comic book company and working with a team to help bring make all of my visions Reality. \n\nThese comics will be extremely cinematic. As if you'll be watching a Movie inside of a book basically.\n\nSpider-Man  is my all time favorite hero. So I'll personally be making my very own  Spider-Man related comic series.  \n\nCalled \"Spider-man The Adventures of  Dave and the Spider-squad\". The protagonist is  an 18 year old bullied  boy named Dave.  Dave's personally and emotions is very similar to  mines.\n\nThe Plot of this is Story  is \"One morning, Dave had woken up from bed to see a small bite mark on  his hand. Little did he know that he had been bite by a radioactive  spider. Giving him amazing superpowers that allows him to become a  Reality warper\".\n\nNow that Dave had  become a Reality warper. He has turned his Reality into a complete  fantasy world. Bringing all kinds of amazing things from his imagination  to life. Dave had also brought some of his own Spider-men and women to  life. specifically from anime. Such as \"Fate Stay Night\".\n\nIn  this Film, Dave and the gang travels through different  Dimensions/Universes. Mainly from video games such as \"Dark souls III\"  \"Legend of Zelda\" \"Fornite\" \"Metal gear solid\" and \"Final Fantasy\".  Fighting different monsters and enemy's from these Universes.\n\n Some of those anime  Spider-men/Spider-women will be from actual anime shows such as \"Soul  Eater\", \"Fate Stay Night\" and \"Comet Lucifer\". Mainly cause of all the  girls from these shows! Like Liz and Patty, Kaon, Sougo, Roman, Saber,  Rin Tohsaka Ect.\n\nI love anime  mainly cause of these beautiful girls! All of they're Spider-woman suits  in my Stories will have holes in the center of they're suits so all of  you readers would see they're belly buttons.\n\nI  forgot to tell you that I'm also into feet. Basically like Quentin  Tarantino. There won't be a lot of feet scenes in my Movie series, but  there will definitely be a good amount of them in a few number of scenes  throughout the Story.\n\nThe stunts  and fight scenes will most definitely  the best thing's about these  Stories. Such as Dave and his crew jumping off extremely tall structures   with an overhead view to make it feel like you're actually there.",

I mean it's hard not to get down about it.  I'm a depressed, anxiety prone, PTSD suffering son of a bitch.  My job is hard, and I'm fairly successful - but my success is definitely a result of doubling down and doing nose to the grindstone work, rather than any networking or people skills I may have.  I've definitely seen coworkers and peers get promoted or move on to presitigious jobs because - they are competent enough, have a wide social and professional network, are generally positive people that other people enjoy working with.  I'm just this sullen depressed loner that has trouble making friends with people, even at work, and the only reason I've gotten this far is because I've adapted and worked twice as hard as other people.  Even then I've seen less qualified people rise farther than me simply because they were competent enough and they were friends w the right people.\n\nI just get down about it.  Even in a field like Software Engineering I have to work twice as hard just to survive.  Just venting, I'm trying really trying to change my attitude, be more positive, do healthy things for myself, and stretch myself more socially - but I think fundamentally I have deep rooted depression and I'm at a disadvantage professionally.",

            "selftext": "This is a long story... I have been passionate about soccer my whole life. My dream has always been to play pro. I played the sport as a kid, high school and junior college then stopped because I had some bad coaching that interfered with my stats and couldn\u2019t make it any further. 2015 was the year I was on my prime. Now that I am 24 I have graduated with an AG Business bachelors degree I am having a hard time finding a job that I want. A friend told me about a tryout opportunity with PSC Pro Soccer Consulting LTD and I want to go but I am unsure and everyone in my family does not support me and talk me down making me feel bad. In my honest opinion, I know I was a good player when I was 20,21. I was inactive for 3,4 years that I weigh more. I started bodybuilding as a hobbie right after junior college soccer. I have a student loan to pay and I am not financially stable. Doing this tryout would hurt me financially and it is a low success rate that I get signed. The tryout is in 3 months but I am unsure on weather I should focus 100% on finding a good job to pay my loan or do both (finding a job) and training for the tryout. My family don\u2019t agree because they think it\u2019s a waste of money and don\u2019t think I will make it. They think I should save that money for my student loan. On the other hand, what\u2019s living life without a dream? My point is, I don\u2019t wanna grow old and say \u201c I didn\u2019t do enough to pursue my dreams\u201d and regret trying... but at the same time I feel unsure that I could compete with the top skilled guys. I have been crying and feeling bad about myself with some suicidal thoughts because I feel like I live in a bubble. My mom thought me to be insecure and don\u2019t set high goals, only the ones she think is best for me. I am confused in what I want to do and would appreciate your advice.",

I can pull all nighters and feel dead all day but then somewhere around 7-8 o\u2019clock the tiredness always goes away and doesn\u2019t come back until morning. And depression makes it hard for me to get out bed when I do wake up, especially since I feel like a failure who can\u2019t wake up till noon. I used to take melatonin and probably will again, I just stopped because I don\u2019t like being on meds that aren\u2019t completely necessary, and I was fine without it for a while. I\u2019ll take it until my sleeping is back on track and then go from there. If anyone has any other advice though, I\u2019m all ears. Thanks for listening to me vent.",

            "selftext": "This is going to be kind of long so bear with me. I have been going through a lot within the past two months. My sons now ex girlfriends house burnt down in July, the day before his birthday. I took her, her dad, and her dog in for a couple months. Let them have my living room til her dad got back on his feet. My son is 14 and his ex is 13 and dont worry they never slept in the same room. No way lol. During that time we were trying to cope with my mans osteoarthritis, spinal stenosis, and bulging disk. He has back surgery next month. Also during the past 2 months all of his bands equipment got stolen...$10k worth. I also got into my first fender bender, everyone was ok though. There's more... My son and his girlfriend broke up and I didnt even know because they were still being somewhat affectionate. I did not know until she tried to kill herself in front of my kid, in my house, and blamed him for it. He had told me he hadnt even wanted to be with her or be affectionate but if she didnt she would freak out and get sad so he felt like he had to. She went to the psyche ward for a week and then her and her dad moved out. They were going to be our new room mates as our room mate told us he couldnt afford to live her anymore, but since all that happened not a chance. My room mate is moving in with my best friend, which is his girlfriend now. This is going to be hard on us as we arent sure what to do yet. Im going back to work and we are looking for people to rent rooms as we dont want to lose this house. But meanwhile my best friend keeps apologizing for letting our room mate move in with her soon while we are going through so much. I keep telling her its not her fault. I mean, if he didnt move there he would have moved somewhere else. We talked about this a couple weeks ago and I assured her I am not mad. The thing is all of this has led me back into depression. I have cyclothemia ( it's almost like bipolar just more mild) and anxiety disorder. When I get like this I tend to just want to be alone and not really talk to anyone. It works for me. I did go and get help and got my meds doubled and got set up with a new psychiatrist. Sometimes I just dont want to think or talk about my situation. I just want to get it figured out and only be concerned with fixing it. She keeps calling me and wanting to talk about it but I keep telling her that it doesn't help me and I don't feel like being reminded of it. We got into an arguement yesterday because she kept apologizing cuz she thinks she is fucking up my life and I tried to reassure her and that my depression has nothing to do with her. I told her Im depressed and I just want to be alone for now to deal with things. She told me that because I'm depressed I'm supposed to talk fo friends and let them be there for me. She said she also needs me to support her. I just dont feel like I need that right now. I told her a week ago that I apologize in advance if I am distant and that I just do not have it in me to be there for others right now. I also cannot handle listening to others drama. I would like to be there for others but cannot until I fix myself first. She said she got it and that she would leave me alone for now. I thought that was gonna be it but she then texts.me a few minutes later to tell me she thought of hanging herself the day before. I told her to please not do that, know that she is not alone (she has a boyfriend and another best friend she can go to), and to think of her daughter. I told her she should seek help, in the nicest way I could and told her I loved her. It just upset me that after I told her I can't handle anymore she then drops that bomb on me. I just dont know what to do anymore. Am I being a bad friend by putting myself and family first for once? All I can think about is them right now. I didnt even want to bring any of this up today bit felt maybe it would be helpful to post on here about it. None of you know me, so less judgement I hope. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for reading this long mess.\n\nTL;DR Going through a lot, my friend is not understanding I just want solitude while I am depressed and dealing with things cuz thats how I deal. Not sure if I am doing something wrong. Need advice. Thanks",

I don't have a plan, my parents said they won't pay for college since i left the house (they were toxic as fuck) i think this is the best cade scenario of my life and i can't be happy, it's like I'm cursed or something, my girlfriend loves me but I'm scared, i don't know if i wanna be with her forever, making videos depresses the hell out of me because i have a fake personality for the camera (because honestly, who would watch a boring youtuber) i feel trapped and i just want to be happy, man, why can't i be just happy and record more videos and have a fucking easy life, I'm fucking everything up and it's not like i can just change my mood\n\nAnd i can't leave youtube, i don't wanna go to college or have a normal job, i also have worked too hard to leave everything behind\n\nAnyway, i just needed to vent, I'm writing this on a park while listening to a shrek song Playlist and I'm not feeling better lmao\n\nI'm not killing myself but i think about it constantly, i feel like i would do it if things were really fucked up, like i lose everything and become homeless fucked up, i dont know what I'm doing",

            "selftext": "After my first rollercoaster relationship we decided to call it quits and I accepted it and got on with my life. I see him all around campus and sometimes he talks to me. Before talking to me he unfriended me on Facebook so I just got on with my life. However afterwards, a couple of days later, I accidentally like one of his tweets one evening, and he deactivated the account. And I only realised this after two or so months. Then on his birthday weekend I on two occasions get off the bus early from uni to my house and his area is along the way to my place. Then later on campus I'm getting a bus from the gym and realise that I MIGHT see him and understand what I'm doing is not okay so I move away. I've since avoided my impulses to see him.\n\nI mean, it was intentional that I got off the bus earlier than usual and I knew that I have to walk past his area. I think I was hoping to see him on all of those occasions. I was going home but I also was at that bus stop hoping to see him. Another occasion went to the bar with my friend because he sometimes goes there with his friends. Not cool, I know.\n\nWhat if he saw me? What if I ruined his day?I feel SO GUILTY. I feel like dying. I know what I did isn\u2019t okay, but I just need some help. I\u2019m sick to my stomach. I'd appreciate your input as my friends, therapist and family keep on saying I'm NOT a stalker but I just can't get out of this spiral.\n\ntl;dr am i a creepy stalker",

            "selftext": "there isn\u2019t anything else left for me. i just transferred to a new school this year, but it wasn\u2019t my decision, my old school was overpopulated. i\u2019ve never been so alone here. i eat lunch by myself, i don\u2019t have any friends, my only one was my boyfriend of just over a year, but he still goes to my old school. last night he told me he wanted to break up. i never saw it coming, last sunday was our one year anniversary and we had a great day. i thought he loved me but turns out he\u2019s been thinking about it for a week and didn\u2019t know how to bring it up. i love him more than anything and asked if we could work it out, but it\u2019s like he just has given up. our relationship isn\u2019t crazy, we loved each other so much and were always there for one another. i don\u2019t think i\u2019ve ever been so heartbroken before because i didn\u2019t even know he felt like this. i hurts even more because he never once talked to me about how he was feeling. he says it\u2019s because we don\u2019t go to the same school anymore and we can\u2019t see each other everyday, but if he really loved me that wouldn\u2019t be such a problem. this new school has caused so many problems, i have such bad social anxiety now, i feel like i can\u2019t even go in public and i close myself off and don\u2019t talk to anyone. it\u2019s so hard and i want to end it. i know it\u2019s selfish or whatever, but i\u2019ve been feeling suicidal for the past month and this recent event really topped it off. i remember not being suicidal, it was fine, and i understand that i could get back to that place eventually. but i don\u2019t want to. i actually want this to be the end. i wanted to grow up and be a research psychologist. but i don\u2019t have any motivation to do so anymore. i know it would hurt the people around me if i took my own life and i feel really bad about that, but i feel like i need to do this. this world simply isn\u2019t meant for me anymore, i\u2019ve lived my life, i\u2019ve had good times and bad times. i haven\u2019t seen or experienced everything, but i\u2019ve had enough to know that i don\u2019t need anymore. i know i could eventually not be depressed and stuff, but i don\u2019t want to, what\u2019s the point of living a so so life where always in the back of your head you wish you would have done it when you could have. i guess i\u2019m coming here just to declare that i might do it. maybe i won\u2019t today, but sometime this week would be ideal. i don\u2019t even know how to do it though, the only option i really have would be to slit my arm really bad, but i think that\u2019s really painful. i don\u2019t wanna hang my self because it seems too gruesome, and i can\u2019t shoot myself because don\u2019t have access to a gun. if i cut my arm and survived they\u2019d probably have to amputate it or something and i don\u2019t want that. i know people will be sad, and it will impact them, and it\u2019s terrible of me to know that but still want to. but i feel like i\u2019ve always done so much for other people, i\u2019ve been their backbones, and for once i want to do something for me. this is what i want. i might be too scared though. god this paragraph is so long and i apologize. i just needed to say it.",

Long story I won't go in to. \n\n3 years after that I got fucked over by a roommate who stole $4000 from me. \n\nAnd last week I was in a car accident. I was not at fault, as a 18 wheeler fucking rear ended me. Today I found out that since my car is a 2007, the insurance isn't going to fix it. They're just going to give me the worth of the car, which is fuck all. Like $1500. I can't afford a new car and I certainly can't fucking get shit for $1500. So I'm just fucked because some fucking cunt truck driver wasn't paying attention. \n\nSo now that my car is scrap. I have nothing left. I have literally fucking nothing to my name. \n\nI haven't drank in 6 years since that night I tried to kill myself. Not one drop. \n\nBut god fucking damn. As soon as work is over today I am going to get the biggest bottle of fucking whiskey I can afford and I'm just going to try and drown myself in it. Maybe it'll work this time. \n\nFuck all of this. Why do I do any of this shit.",

However, I'm noticing an occasional stutter when I speak. It's kind of tripping me out. I've been on Prozac for 4 months now and the issue has persisted. It's nothing too major,  it happens like maybe 3-4 times a day with a word here and there (and mostly when I'm nervous). \n\nHas anyone else experienced something similar while taking an SSRI?",

I just lost my job this week and lost my best friend at the end of June due to complications of pregnancy /  childbirth after 3 months of being in a coma. My relationship with SO is not been a smooth path for the vast majority of relationship and NOW it's got alot worst with the lost of my job.  I just started this week with some personal counseling for myself and the 1st session went well. Now starts the battle to find a new job, my past few jobs have not been long term ie 1.5 to 3yrs at most and I have been released every single time. Aka Fired.. I feel this last job was lost due to my life situation and mental health. Now I feel like I got a steep uphill climb!",

            "selftext": "This is my first post here so yeah. \nI\u2019m at the end of my wits completely. I\u2019ve never had too many friends. Never had any I guess. I\u2019m 16. A person I thought was my only friend left me last April and I still think of it everyday. She was everything to me. I still don\u2019t know why she left. Just a week before I made a 13 page essay on how to cope with her problems for her and constantly called her all night to make sure she was ok. I wasn\u2019t being clingy as she requested it. I did everything for her. I was just blocked on everything at once. Another person I really liked who promised they\u2019d be my friend blocked me from a misunderstanding and I can\u2019t talk to either of them and I lose so much sleep over it. I\u2019ve already had so many problems over depression. And this is lumping it all. My parents don\u2019t want me either. They refuse to give me any sort of medication to help as they think it causes brain damage even though my therapist has been asking them to. I have nothing. Absolutely nothing in my life anymore. Nothing has changed since April. I\u2019m a socially awkward mess. I don\u2019t want to be alive anymore. Every second of every day my mind thinks how bad things are and how I kiss everything and there\u2019s no way for me to escape it. I was sad before this all happened and now everything\u2019s gone and I\u2019m just done. I don\u2019t even care if it gets better. I don\u2019t want to see life anymore even if it\u2019s happy. I\u2019m just, done. I want to die, but I don\u2019t think I have the courage to legitimately shoot myself or jump off a building. I just can\u2019t live anymore with everything going on. My parents do a bunch of stuff I don\u2019t wanna explain. I\u2019m lonely. I don\u2019t even know if I want to not be alone. It hurts to lose. Every friendship I\u2019ve had has ended horribly. I\u2019ve had relationships in the past that completely scarred me from the mere idea of dating someone. I was abused through one and when I spoke about it to her, she said she\u2019s killing herself and it would be my fault, then didn\u2019t talk to me for a week. I thought she was dead but when she came back she just laughed and told me to leave. She lied just to hurt me. I have had many other experiences but I don\u2019t want to talk about them right now. I\u2019m just done. I don\u2019t know what to do anymore. My parents put Qustodio and parental locks on my phone. They say that they are gonna stay there till I\u2019m 18. So I can\u2019t even do anything I used to do on my phone without having a report being sent to them every hour on what I did. I\u2019m just done. I feel so stuck. It\u2019s not gonna get better and I don\u2019t care if it does. I can\u2019t keep going.",

I was wondering if anyone has any tips on how to help her, even if it\u2019s small help. We have been together for 5 years now and I know she\u2019s been suffering from this ever since she was young, she\u2019s so strong and a beautiful person but she expresses how she feels suicidal and it\u2019s difficult seeing her just give up on the world. Any tips would help a lot, thank you all and bless anyone who suffers from depression.",

I'm scared to seek help because I want to get a trade through the defence force and don't want any mental health records on my medical history for them to turn me down as they are literally my last chance to turn my life around.

            "selftext": "i\u2019ve regretted making this post for a while now, thought I could just shake it off. but I think last night, and these past couple months have just finally pushed me to the edge. i\u2019ve always sealed with depression for a good amount of time, ever since i got my first year done in high school. it\u2019s been ups and downs where I am really happy, than when i\u2019m just really sad. i\u2019ve had several jobs in 2019 so far. I wasted 2 years on a career that I couldn\u2019t even get around my town. I am now at a local restaurant. I can\u2019t pay bills, i\u2019m so far behind right now, i\u2019m part time but I take more hours, the girl I was dating was very toxic, the whole relationship was toxic. she kept cheating on me and leaving me for any other guy. than when they would treat her bad she\u2019d just come back to me. she wouldn\u2019t let me do anything if I did she\u2019d get mad, but I let her do whatever she wanted. I fell in love with her, only the 2nd person i\u2019ve ever loved. my parents won\u2019t help me. i\u2019ve been asking for there help to get a new vehicle for the longest time, but to no avail. my brother had 3 vehicles in highschool, and I couldn\u2019t get a new one. mine keeps breaking down after a couple months it\u2019ll be a new problem. I just feel like a burden on my family, I know they love me but i\u2019m just tired of everything and how my life is being dealt to me. i\u2019ve tried suicide before but i\u2019m to much of a pussy to actually do it, funny right? I want to die, but I can\u2019t. i\u2019ve been hit by lightning, shot in the eye with a bb gun (dr said I was close to either being killed or being brain dead), i\u2019ve been in several bad car accidents, i\u2019ve been in fights and was definitely beat tf up, i\u2019ve overdosed on prometheus evil,(ended up blacked out for 2 days) and i\u2019m still alive, I think it\u2019s fascinating how i\u2019m still alive, i\u2019ve done so many drugs to kill myself but it\u2019s never worked. nothings ever worked. i\u2019ve had the gun to my head but I couldn\u2019t pull the trigger, I cocked the chamber so many times so many bullets just on the floor of my dads truck. he knew, but he never said anything about it. I just feel like i\u2019m going no where. the only good thing right now is i\u2019m going to take my act soon and try and enroll into school. I guess i\u2019m making this just to vent, or find out if there is a way to kill myself without feeling any pain. i\u2019ve searched online pretty much to page 20 reading every article and all they say is \u201cno you don\u2019t want to do it\u201d but never explain a way to do it. my truck broke down last night in the middle of a busy road of my town. I was able to pull off on a side road and just beat the fuck out of my dash. my hand hurts so bad right now, and there\u2019s so much blood in my truck. I just sat there and cried for about an hour. i\u2019ve been in overdraft for the last couple months, every check I get from work is just getting me out of debt, putting gas, and buying weed to atleast keep me happy for a little bit. it also helps with my eye, I feel daily pain in, the pressure gets high when i\u2019m stressed. lately the pains been unbearable, almost to the point I want to just rip it out. i\u2019ve also suffered with anger problems, letting too much build up and just flashing out on anything. i\u2019ll black out from anger and just do things I won\u2019t remember, I regret a lot of them. I just miss when I never felt like this. I want to get help but I can\u2019t afford professional help, and i don\u2019t want to talk to any of my friends about it, mainly because I don\u2019t have anymore friends to talk to. I feel like getting help won\u2019t really help though. idk what i\u2019ll do eventually, if I find a way to die without me doing it i\u2019ll be able to do it, but I can\u2019t just force myself to kill myself. I just feel trapped most of the time. I run out of money to buy drugs, anything pain pills or whatever to take the edge off. than I get angry and depressed and just not mentally stable. sorry if this isn\u2019t the right place to post this, but I just don\u2019t even know what to do anymore. i\u2019ve started having mini strokes with my face, my eye will seize up making the right side of my face freak out and start twitching than I can\u2019t speak, if I do I slur and I can barely understand myself, I get light headed, my heart almost feels like it\u2019s stopping. i\u2019m just scared, i\u2019m so scared, 3 people have died recently within the friend group I used to have, 2 committed suicide. I just wish I knew how they were able to get the courage to do it. life fucking sucks ):",

I have been so stressed, depressed and overwhelmed that all I can think about is finding some painkillers and just numbing myself. I had an addiction to vicodin and percocet for years as a teenager and a young adult. It started with my grandmother. She is seriously, genuinely disabled and takes vicodin for the pain. I began to get migraines mid teens and I would ask if we had tylenol, we didn't, but she had her vicodin. She readily gave it to me and that's what started it. I would then constantly tell her I has migraines, my back hurt. Something or anything. Once she stopped giving them to me I began to steal them from her. My grandmother had a percocet prescription and I stole those. When I moved out on my own at 19 I began to buy, sell and use them. It first started as a way to make cash, honestly. It quickly turned into a source for my pills. I went downhill pretty quickly. I've been clean for about 3 years but some days, some days I really, really miss how they made me feel. I felt blissfully numb and nothing mattered. It was easy to just take them and forget responsibilities. I finally decided to become sober when I began to mix the pills with getting drunk constantly. It was putting my health at risk and jeopardizing everyone and everything. But some days...",

This is my first time being in a serious relationship and I don't want to let my mental health mess it up. \n\nHe knows and understands the disorders, but doesn't know how to help/support me when I have an episode. I don't know either since I've never had a person like him be there for me. \n\nSo far I've told him to just comfort me and hold me when I'm crying. I told him that I have sensory overload sometimes and that I don't like being told \"it's gonna be okay.\" \n\nI really don't know what else I want him to do since all I've ever done before was deal with it myself (and therapist), but Idk how to have a partner help me since it's a very different kind of relationship. \n\nI would really appreciate your suggestions and support.

            "selftext": "My depression manifests as extreme anger turned inwards and emotional numbness as a cope. Occasionally, like today, I'll feel profoundly sad. My girlfriend broke up with me two weeks ago. We are both trying to get clean from a serious drug problem (heroin and benzos), and although we never used together - we struggle with the same addictions. She's in an IOP program and doing well - and I'm in a sober living house and am doing well in terms of staying clean.\n\nBut in terms of depression, I feel worthless and I feel like a terrible person. She broke up with me because I wasn't being real with her about some thoughts I was having to relapse, or I should say initially we seperated; but then a day or two later I guess she crept on my reddit account and found a comment I made a month earlier about how the first day I moved into sober-living I relapsed on fentanyl and alcohol.\n\nTo make shit worse, the day she found this out was also the day I found out I am being charged with (another) felony. She called me confronting me about the relapse right after I had gotten off the phone with my lawyer and my dad and I was already in such a dark place. I felt like I had lost everything at once, and the thought of losing her on top of everything led me to lie to her - even though deep-down I knew the *only* possible way she could know about that relapse was by reading through my comment history - cos I hadn't told anyone about that. She gave me several chances to come clean, and I kept lying because I was so scared. \n\nI regret this decision every waking moment, because I've never felt love like I have towards this girl (I'm almost 29 and she was the first real gf I ever had); and I just feel so fatally-flawed cos I couldn't do the one thing I needed to do to keep her which was just to be fucking honest. Like what the fuck is wrong with me..?! I lied to her a lot throughout the relationship about my using, and I did it despite knowing it hurt her as deeply as if I had been cheating. I've been trying so hard this year to stay clean and to live an honest life, and I'd always tell her the truth (and everyone) about everything else in my life and how I really felt; but when it would come to my using, the shame and guilt and fear of her reaction (she could get abusive) would lead me to hiding things. I would justify that I'm hurting her by being honest, that's why I never told her about the relapse; I resigned myself to stay clean and keep that secret buried (and sort of did, I used kratom for a little while and was abusing my meds until shortly before we broke up).\n\nNow I just feel so desolate though. This girl really brought me outside of myself, and if I am being honest - I became codependant. The day before we started dating, I tried to kill myself with an overdose. We had been talking a few weeks but hadnt me up, and when I told her what happened; she was at my house 2 hours later - and we connected so strongly that that was that. This memory alone fucks me up. She literally saved my life by being there for me at a time where I would've tried again, and I couldn't even be honest about something that we both struggle with.\n\nWe havent spoken in two weeks, and while I know she still has to have strong feelings for me (we talked about having kids together ffs, I've never had that convo with another person; amd she *said* she hadn't either) - I have no idea if I'm ever gonna get another chance to show her that I can change and be a real and honest person. Hope for that while I work on myself is all I want in the world, but I'm beginning to lose that entirely - and what the fuck is the point of any of this shit if you lose the love of your life and it's over and you had your chance and you blew it?!\nI can't envision myself with any other woman, not would I even want one. She is everything I ever wanted in a person.\n\nI just hate myself for the way I am, and I just want to change myself. Idk if there's any advice to even really be had - I've just been feeling like giving up this morning after I woke up and crept on her Insta and saw her beautiful eyes and smile, and saw that she looked so happy with her friends absent of me. Like I was what was bringing her down all along. I just wish that I didn't feel like there was something I missed.",

I almost can but my states cost of living is really high. Like 1200 a month for a one bedroom. This really sets me back with relationships because I feel like I should be able to support myself before I get into anything and it\u2019s been about 5 years or so since I\u2019ve tried anything with anyone. \n\nMy rents are both addicts and pretty unreliable to even try and talk too. I haven\u2019t been able to get in contact with my mom in a few months even tho I pay her phone bill. I\u2019ve got friends but when I try to talk to them about my problems,I think I make them uncomfortable. Or maybe they just can\u2019t relate. \n\nI\u2019m really depressed and spend almost 100% of my time alone with my cat. I work alone and when I get home I usually make some dinner and play some game or something until I have to go to sleep. I work like 10-12 hrs a day starting at 3am so I do go to bed relatively early. \n\nI don\u2019t want to kill myself or think I\u2019m a real danger to myself. When I was 16 I slit my one wrist all of the way down and there\u2019s such a big scar that I can play it off as a bad burn. It was one of the scariest moments of my life and I don\u2019t want to feel like that again but I haven\u2019t ever really been able to get it out of my head. That it would just be better, easier.",

            "selftext": "Is anyone else unemployed and, because they lack stability and a \"normal\" daily routine, their days are just a mess? I struggle with depression anyway, but a lack of healthy routine makes it ten times worse. My poor sleep pattern is particularly hard to deal with. \n\nI (24f) am a recent university graduate who has been unemployed for just one month (was lucky enough to get a temp position over the summer) but already I can feel myself sliding into a deep depression. I am living with my parents while I search for jobs - I am very fortunate in that they're letting me stay with them rent-free as long as I need and they're paying for my food, too. I have job interviews lined up and I know it will only be a matter of time until I get a job. I know my life is not bad and so many people have it worse than I do. However, my mental health is still shit. \n\nI don't sleep until 4am most nights and don't wake up until noon. I have tried to correct this many times, to no avail. After waking up, I lie around in bed for an hour or two because I can't find the energy to get up. While this is happening, I'm berating myself for being such a lazy piece of shit, which only makes me want to stay in bed more. When I do eventually get up, it takes me a further hour or two to actually get anything done. For example, I will need to shower, put on clothes, eat something and tidy my room a little (I really hate mess). By the time I have done this, it is 3pm or later. Usually I will leave the house - either to go for a walk, go to a cafe or to the library. I also have access to an office I can use 24/7, which is lucky. So sometimes I will go there to work on job applications. I had been going jogging in the evenings for a while, which really helped with depression, but then I injured myself and have had to take time out, which really sucks. \n\nI suppose this is a \"routine\" of sorts, but I feel miserable. Not waking up at a \"normal\" time makes me really unproductive and lethargic. It feels like wading through syrup, everything is so much effort. Its like my body is just really unhappy with the pattern its stuck in. Is anyone else in the same boat or does anyone have any advice?",

I'm struggling to get into seeing a different psychiatrist, so I'm forced to stick to see this guy who has me on ssris, benzos, antipsychotics, and amphetamines.

            "selftext": "I apologize for starting with such a dramatic title, but I've been struggling for a long time now. I've become progressively more tired of life and I'm lacking energy and motivation to do anything.\n\nI have no hobbies or interests. I've been feeling numb for a long time. For the last 7 years I've been an avid gamer, but lately I've barely touched any video games because I'm not good enough to have fun, so I only get frustrated further. I've just slept all day once I got home from school. It's really hard to wake up in the morning when I have nothing to look forward to and all my energy goes to just getting back to school in the morning.\n\nI don't know what I'm going to do. I've been in therapy since April of this year but it has only made my problems worse. I was reluctant to go there in the first place, since I knew it wouldn't help anyway. I guess the good thing is that I finally got my depression diagnosed, but it just started causing more problems. I have bad relations with my family and relatives and there's no way I can ever talk to them. Especially my parents are lunatics and they seem to be angry at me for my depression.\n\nI don't have any friends either. I've never had any. I'm not really able to make any regardless. I have no one to talk to so I've come here as a last resort, but I'm not really expecting much I guess.\n\nSometimes when I'm really having a tough time, I become very suicidal and it just gets worse every day. I've been running on sheer willpower for the last 4 years, but now I'm out. I've been ready to give up for a long time now. I need something to look forward to when I wake up. A hobby I could be passionate about, but everything I want to do is way too expensive and time consuming. I'm a very competitive person and I really want to be good at something, just one thing I like. But it's futile.\n\nMusic has helped me a lot, but it's not a solution long term. I can't just become a braindead headphone wearing corpse and stay in my bed for years. I really need help, but so far I've managed to make everyone angry online. Hobby suggestions are welcome, but you really need to think out of the box to get me even slightly interested. I don't find pleasure in normal activities. Only thing that has given me pleasure in the past was winning at video games, but my mental health has deteriorated so badly I'm not in shape to play video games competitively anymore, nor do I really have time to get good again either.\n\nThanks in advance. I hope this post doesn't piss anyone off too much. \n\nP.S: I actually cannot view the rules of r/depression so I hope this post doesn't break any of them. Sorry for the trouble if it does.",

I want my life back. Problem is, I\u2019m on my parents insurance. \nWhile I do want to go to them for help, the idea of going up to them and saying \u201chey I think I have depression, some days are harder than others\u201d is absolutely terrifying and I also just don\u2019t want them to be bothered. I\u2019ve done what I think is an ok job at hiding my issues but occasionally something slips through and the last thing I want is to explain myself and them to realizes all those little slip-ups were part of a much larger issue, that I\u2019ve been struggling since atleast November of last year (and that\u2019s just my earliest recount, it goes back further). I don\u2019t want them to feel like bad parents for not realizing but I desperately want their help in this, but like the title says, there\u2019s never a good time to bring it up.\n\nThere\u2019s always something that prevents me from just saying it, I try to find an evening to pull mom aside and let her know? My sister is over that evening for dinner. Or we had a vacation planned near the time I want to discuss it and what sort of person would I be if I put that in their heads? \u201cCant wait to go camping oh and btw I\u2019ve got depression maybe.\u201d  \nI just want to get help but not burden everyone else with this before I know for certain.",

Before talking to me he unfriended me on Facebook so I just got on with my life. However afterwards, a couple of days later, I accidentally like one of his tweets one evening, and he deactivated the account. And I only realised this after two or so months. Then on his birthday weekend I on two occasions get off the bus early from uni to my house and his area is along the way to my place. Then later on campus I'm getting a bus from the gym and realise that I MIGHT see him and understand what I'm doing is not okay so I move away. I've since avoided my impulses to see him.\n\nI mean, it was intentional that I got off the bus earlier than usual and I knew that I have to walk past his area. I think I was hoping to see him on all of those occasions. I was going home but I also was at that bus stop hoping to see him. Another occasion went to the bar with my friend because he sometimes goes there with his friends. Not cool, I know.\n\nWhat if he saw me? What if I ruined his day?I feel SO GUILTY. I feel like dying. I know what I did isn\u2019t okay, but I just need some help. I\u2019m sick to my stomach. I'd appreciate your input as my friends, therapist and family keep on saying I'm NOT a stalker but I just can't get out of this spiral.\n\ntl;dr am i a creepy stalker",

I cannot for the life of me keep up with basic hygiene. My hair is long, it\u2019s about to my tail bone. \n\nAn example of what life is like for me right now. My sleeps are incredibly interrupted as if I\u2019m waking every few hours, like I\u2019ve forgotten something. Because I\u2019ve rustled around so much, my hair becomes so tangled. After a few days of really life affecting depression (I work as a temp, I\u2019m off now and I\u2019ve stopped all hygiene basically) my hair is such an awful heavy matted mess, because I end up breaking into tears and hating myself and being sad at the pain in my skull that I throw it into a terrible bun and then go back into my dissociative states around the house until my other brother gets home. I try to braid it, I try to not move in my sleep. But I also have rhythmic movement disorder, which makes it worse.\n\nHow do you keep up with brushing hair when it feels like I have no willpower or energy to do so? I\u2019ve never felt the \u201ccan\u2019t get out of bed\u201d feeling as bad until this year, after my mum. Life feels extra difficult. I can\u2019t keep up, it\u2019s like I\u2019m always running and missing things as I go by but I keep running.",

I don't want to deal with their shit, their lies, them being nosy, asking questions about nothing, wasting my time with small chat about absolutely nothing of importance.  \n\nI'm not saying I don't want to be around people but I get so sick of people wasting my time with nothing that amounts to nothing. Like it's honestly okay to just be around someone and shut up. And when they just talk and talk trying to just fill the air I just want to shut them up permanently. \n\nAnd the worst part is I flat out tell people you don't have to make idle chit chat with me I'd prefer if you didn't as I see it as pointless and time wasting. But they don't listen. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I don't mind chatting if we're catching up, talking about a show which we both watch, sharing information on a topic we enjoy, but just mindless chatter is the most irritating thing to me lately. I used to didn't mind and now the more I go through therapy and the more I'm learning to put myself first the angrier I get with the actions of others. It's like they have no respect for others and when you ask them to stop something they act offended they you even suggest that they shut up their mindless drivel. \n\nIDK I'm just a bit scared I might be going from depressed to depressed and angry. Is this a part of getting better or am I taking a turn for the worst?",

I don\u2019t even know where I\u2019m going with this.

I hide every part of myself from people because I think they'll judge me.\n\nOutside of family I can only think of a few people that would actually give a shit if I killed myself and I feel that some people that claim they like my friendship would actually be happier if I killed myself.\n\nThe only reason I haven't ended myself is because i dont want to cause my family grief.",

I see other people being happy and having fun together and I don't get how I can't have that. All my life I have been longing for a deep social connection with one single other person, you know, like finding love (I know it doesn't exist) or having a picture book father-son friendship. Nearing my thirties I don't think I will ever have any relationship like this or similar. I always blamed myself , assuming I suck at social interactions or something and no one ever really wants to spend time with me. I tried really hard many times to get \"better\", but it doesn't help. I also put other people before myself every day but I never really get much back\n\nI actually do have a few people around me but I still feel alone as all of these connections feel so superficial. Pretty much all my \"friendships\" are centered around drinking and at the end of the day, I hate it. You also have to consider that it is very much a part of our local culture and a common thing to do. If you sit at a social gathering and don't drink, other people will ask what's wrong with you.\n\nI tried starting new hobbies and finding new friends, but it either ends up the same way or I can't just really connect with anyone. I also feel like I wasted my life and I am too old to get good at anything anymore. Depression also makes it really hard to keep motivation and doing even the most fundamental things.\n\nI don't know what to do. More often than not this feeling of solitude is completely unbearable and I wish I would just disappear. The only thing that stops me from doing so is that I am too scared to kill myself.",

Not gonna talk about my horrible past or growing up with a messed up family, or military service that messed me up even more. I've had MDD and C-PTSD for 14 years now.\n\nI had my first ever relationship that ended recently at 34 with a women I wasn't really into, I tried saving the relationship numerous times over the 2 years as I'm terrified to go back to what I am feeling now and felt before.\n\nI've been abused and used by this women but it wasn't all bad, really enjoyed dating and going out doing stuff I would have never done before. She gave me confidence to get a dog and now I have a service dog in training. That's a plus.\n\nBut, only reason I met her was because I got so desperate 2 years ago and went on craigslist looking for a connection. I started sacrificing my body and let gay guys do things to me to get a wisp of feeling that I'm wanted. But eventually I met her through there as she was a lost 20 yr old, self cutting, depressed, thinking she's ugly and suicidal. Helped her build confidence and always praised her and supported her. Now she's thriving, in college, honouroll student, has friends, family everything and I am stuck in a freezer. Still a loser. Lonelier than ever.\n\nWe broke up a couple days ago, we already broke up multiple times in the past and it should have ended long time ago but I just can't let go because I literally have no one. I gained 100lbs being with her for 2 years too. I don't want to feel paranoid and lonely again. I don't want to sacrifice my body for men to feel some form of fake attachment.\n\nI have zero friends, zero family, no job but have money. I'm scared to do anything as I am scared I'll get injured even worse physically. \n\nI've tried drugs but the psychiatrist said there is none that work for me, they all had very bad side-effects on me. There is no support groups in my area.\n\nI'm really exhausted with life. I don't want to kill myself though. I already attempted it in my service days. I just want a connection, want someone to cuddle, hold and love. Want kids.",

The issue is that due to how tolerance works I now have to smoke a lot (3mo since I started smoking) and an ounce costs 180$.\n\nI barely make enough to cover my expenses as it is, and 180$ twice a month has broken me to the point of asking my parents to help- the issue there is that they too are experiencing financial difficulties because my mother has gone back to school.\n\nIm out of weed today, and as expected I've fallen right back into depression. Thankfully I was lucid enough to warn my partner and friends about this and to not worry if I go reclusive, but I'm gonna be honest I don't know if I'm gonna be ok.\n\nThese past three months have been amazing due to mmj, I honestly believed I was cured because the difference was night and day, I've lost weight, stopped eating as a coping method, I feel like my brain works instead of being this morass of foggy stupidity (ironic that I'm treating that with weed) and in general my QoL has skyrocketed-\n\nBut I guess nothing last forever.\n\nI'm putting all my eggs in the 2020 election, praying to every god that weed be legalized federally. If that doesn't happen I'm really not sure if I can deal with another decade of suicidal depression, especially not after being \"cured\" and then having to live my life lawnmower man style remembering how good I used to feel.\n\nI'm scared. I've rebuilt so much of my life because of weed, I have a boyfriend and I'm enrolled to start classes again in the spring  to pursue a degree in library science and if I can't medicate, I might as well forget an education. Im terrified of Xanax, I've seen it ruin people first hand and I'm too scared to take that risk knowing I have an addictive personality and genetic predisposition to addiction as well.\n\nSo that's my sob story. I just needed to put it out into the world. Not even my dad knows all of this.",

I'm getting fatter and it's terrifying me. My daydreams and thoughts keep me from sleeping. I can't use the bathroom without laxatives because of the stress of thoughts. My teeth are breaking and falling out.\n\nI can't do anything, not even rest, i crave suicide but do not want to hurt my dad whos wife left him and his daughter me is all he has. We talk maybe twice a week even though we live in the same trailer. Therapy was helping me with antidepressant and ptsd medicine as well as \"Check, yup it happened\" method and the \"I did it\" method. But now the \"Check, yup it happened\" is now yeah, I ruined my future an the  \"I did it\" is yes, I did it, I fucked up and cannot fix my mistakes no matter what. \n\nI can't do anything, I tried to go ask if I can get help at social security but they said because I work 1 day a week it shows im capable and benefits aren't an option. I'm crippled with depression, being awake is so painful and I can't even sleep. I want to work, I want to get my degree in MLT, I want to get therapy and get help. I can't, standing up hurts, being alive hurts. \n\nI'm scared my pushing to do these things that im either going to get better or become disabled. Im letting everyone down, even my therapist, I push for them but im breaking and don't know if going to these things is breaking me or not. \n\nWhat do I do? Do I just go? I had to leave work last week because I just couldn't stand without crying from cycling thoughts. I'm losing everything and can't do anything even though I want too. Please help, thank you.",

But as I got on the train home, I met a girl I went in class with in middle school. Which I was done at like, 4 years ago. I was bullied all my 3 years there, and when I now saw her for the first time since that, she still gave me the same look as back then. The look of \"you're not worth anything. You shouldn't be here.\" It could easily have been an annoyed look since there were alot of people on the train, but I saw how her face looked almost happy when she entered. It didn't change to that look until she saw me. I have no idea what I ever did to her or any of the others that bullied me back then.\n\nSeeing that look again sent me straight back to how I felt back then. Scared, alone, sad. I'm trying my best to keep telling myself that that period of my life is over, but god, that hurt.",

            "selftext": "It\u2019s been in my mind lately, but I realized that no matter how much I want to, I\u2019ll never get back with my ex. I keep hoping that one day, he\u2019ll feel better, and we\u2019ll get back together, but I\u2019m starting to realize we\u2019re drifting apart no matter how much either of us try to prevent it (and I\u2019m starting to think I\u2019m the only one who wants to prevent it). He and I still talk every now and then (same school, a fair amount of mutual friends), and whenever we do, I always try to act happy and normal around him, but he always seems uncomfortable or like he doesn\u2019t want me there. When we broke up, he promised that we\u2019ll stay friends, and I\u2019m starting to worry he\u2019s changing his mind. I want to trust what he said, but he\u2019s really not keeping his promise. He\u2019s nice and supportive over text, but in person, he\u2019s awkward, cold, and distant towards me, and it\u2019s really confusing me. I can\u2019t even talk to him anymore without wanting to cry, because it reminds me of what we used to have and how it\u2019ll never be what it used to again. I know i need to move on, but the thought of him with someone else is crippling to me. I don\u2019t know if I can be with anyone because i seriously think he was the only person I could\u2019ve connected with in the way that I did, and for that one person to be with someone else, doing everything we used to, is terrifying. I know that\u2019s dramatic, but i seriously think that could push me to killing myself.\n\nI\u2019m trying to see this as a good thing. I\u2019m trying to use this as a reason to move on and feel better about myself and what\u2019s happening.",

            "selftext": "I was always slightly depressed since high school but things have gotten so much worse I really don't know what I can do at this point. I have some kind of illness/disease that was diagnosed as a stomach issue and only recently I am told by a different doctor that I was misdiagnosed. My \"illness\" has never been in check since I started noticing symptoms at 21, and ever since then things have only  gotten worse. Somedays I feel better than others but I never feel better than 60%. I am constantly fatigued, nauseous, stomach issues, ear ringing ( that one is 100% my fault) overall just feel shitty, and getting minimum amounts of sleep  not by choice ( 740 am as I am typing this ), and to top it off I used to love working out and being active and now due to joint inflammation/pain I can't anymore. To expand on the working out thing when I do I get dizzy and really hot/itchy and my joints feel inflamed for multiple days yet the dr sees \"nothing on xrays\" and all bloodwork/other tests come back with nothing wrong.  I feel like I can't concentrate anymore due to all the stress/anxiety/fatigue and as much of an excuse as this sounds there is no way I can hold a job. Some may say I am making this up or it is in my head but I absolutely know what I feel and am going through. I 100% remember the days when I felt normal and my only issues were slight depression/social anxiety and some confidence issues. I have been to so many doctors, tried so many meds natural and pharmaceutical, changed my diet completely, stopped smoking weed and drinking and absolutely nothing has helped me. I am never up for anything these days because of all of the above, I used to go out and be active and do things now I am home pretty much all day alone and it really sucks. Being so isolated is really bad for my mental health but it feels like there is nothing I can do. I miss my past so much I used to have a good life that I really took for granted and would do anything to go back to those days. At this point I just live in the past it is all I can think about how good the old days were. Every night before bed I just replay all my great old memories and it makes me so much more depressed. I dream about things that I have done/wish I could be doing in my life and they are always so vivid it really feels like I am there, then I wake up and just don't even want to live. Even in my dreams I can't escape my irl problems. I am not looking for attention I am just venting to people who understand I guess, and yeah I have done plenty of therapy before but that can only help so much. I am tired of doctors I am so fucking tired of being tired I wish something would just fall out of the sky and end it for me because I am way too pussy to end it myself. I am going to give it one last go and get tested for diabetes since a lot of my symptoms are also seen with diabetics but if that comes back negative all hope will be completely lost.",

You see, I wanted to die but i was afraid of taking my own life, So I would always ate a whole lot of normal meds like paracetamol and other things (but a whole lot of em) and a whole lot of those silica gel beads in shoe boxes just because it has poison written on it. \nI thought that over time, everything will be fine, but at the end of my highschool years, I became so stressed probably because all of the studies, puberty, teenage hormones plus the acne on my face became worse, I cried every freaking day for two years, I became quite, I started to hate myself, I would cry everyday for no reason and I would cry whenever i see myself in the mirror , i still wanted to die every single day, but i may not love myself but i do love my parents.\nNow at the age of 22, its not as worse as it used to be, but i do cry twice a week, i feel tired everyday, i feel hopeless everyday, i feel like i have no purpose or whatsoever,\nim still struggling to love myself, to have confidence, but i still do feel like i want to die. \nThe feeling is still there, it never left.\nThis is the first time ever im telling anyone about this, im sorry if I sound stupid or annoying :(",

            "selftext": "Hi there everyone. I was married for 5 years. It was one of those marriages that came about from having a child. Me and her lost our first baby from a miscarriage, and we decided fuck it, might as well have one. What she didn't tell me was that she was smoking meth at the same time. She didn't work, and I put in 80 hours a week, so I really wasn't around for anyone to notice. I found out she was pregnant the same night I came home to her smoking from a lightbulb with her friends. I told her I was done, and she cried and told me she was pregnant, so I made her take a test. Thats how I found out I was going to be a father. Cue 5 years of nothing but resentment and anger on my part, working the same hours when she couldn't even be bothered to clean the house.\n\nI hated my life, and she cheated on me after losing a lot of weight that was always a sour spot in our relationship. She took everything from me. Every possession I owned, gone. Thats not a dramatazation. Everything. For 3 months I wanted to park my car in my garage and wait to go to sleep, but I didn't. Then I met a beautiful 18 year old girl I fell in love with, reclaimed some of that time I felt I wasted in a relationship that murdered my spirit. We dated for 4 months, and It was the best time of my entire life. Then she started smoking meth and cheated on me. After all the shit I've been through this year, that was my breaking point. I quit my job, and I've been alone for 3 months drinking alone with no human contact. Ive lost any desire to be alive after feeling nothing but pain and isolation for a year. Everyone says just make changes, go do you. But i cant. I'm trapped in a life with a kid I find it difficult to even love. Ive never been so alone in my life. I didnt want to be a single father, but between child support and the societal pressure to be a good dad, ill never get to be who I want to be. Im fucking trapped, and all I want is to be somewhere where the only job opportunities arent factories where you work so much that you cant sleep, and you lose who you are. I want to be somewhere where the people aren't hicks I have nothing in common with. Im trapped. My 30th birthdays in 3 months, and if I still feel this way, I'm pretty sure Im going to drop a toaster in my bathtub.",

I try to listen to happy songs but that just makes these feeling of melancholy even worse, I'm afraid to even be truly happy for the fact that either something unforeseen will rip it away or my self sabotaging behavior will decide to press that metaphorical self destruct button. It sucks because I put this mask on while at work that I've got everything handled but honestly deep down I really (and I mean REALLY) just want to walk into traffic and rid everyone of the problem that is well Me. Maybe I'm just being melodramatic and sappy but I just want to feel happy again instead of this nothing that I feel in my chest.\n\nTL:DR, Just a rant of me finally pouring my emotions out instead of keeping them bottled up I guess..",

At first it really helped but then it faded away.\n\nThen i started taking digestive enzymes. Seems to solve all stomach problems, but don't take too much as it increase uric acid.\n\nOnce i fixed my stomach, anxiety went to a very low levels.\n\nThe other things is deep sleep. I sleep normal hours but it's not deep. I wake up tired with painful back muscles.\n\nMagnesium+ taurine seems to help. \nI found out that the best sleep i have is when I'm super tired physically, gym don't cut it for me so im trying to play tennis or other sports or walk a lot.\n\nAfter all above seems to easy my anxiety to very low levels.\n\n\nOnce anxiety gone i get depression which is even worse.\n\nI found so far that high dose of Omega 3 increase depression to super high levels. Alcohol seems to be the magic pill but i don't want to rely on that.\n\nI figured out that it might have to do something with high choline levels. Since Omega 3 increase choline and alcohol deplete it. That might be one theory.\n\nOther might have to do something with dopamine, i think alcohol mimic dopamine effects. I tried tyrosine but no effect at all. Will try l-dopa next.\n\nI did a lot of blood work. All is normal except I have high T high estrogen and high prolactin all at the same time. The most odd situation as said my doctor.\nF3 f4 sgbh and all other hormones are in normal levels\n\nI took medication to lower prolactin for almost 9 month, T level sky rocket. The first 2 weeks i felt insanely good, super horny \ud83d\ude00\ud83d\ude00  yet after those 2 weeks i felt no effect at all. Prolactin level went so low T stays very high\n\nI figured out that prolactin is antigonst to dopamine, one gets high other gets low. \n\nSo maybe since dopamine is always low prolactin is high and causing this issues or maybe the other way.\n\nDoes it make sense what I'm thinking here?",

However, I\u2019m just off balance. I have dealt with anxiety/depression since I was about 13 years old. I first started medication at age 21 after months and months of anxiety about mentioning to my primary care doctor. Since then I have tried: lexapro, celexa, buspar, Wellbutrin, and Pristiq. Nothing. Has seemed to be a great fit for me. Either dreaded sexual side effects, awful break through anxiety attacks, depression to the max... etc. The Pristiq was started last month (September 10th) and it made me feel absolutely nuts. I completely stopped it cold turkey after having several panic attacks that spurred severe depressive episodes (worst suicidal ideations I\u2019ve ever had as well as one self harm episode). I know you\u2019re not supposed to stop meds like this (I am a nurse and tell patients this often... but I was scaring myself on it). So I have since made an attempt to go to a psychiatrist (waiting on appt confirmation) so I can get specialized help rather than from my PCP. I\u2019m just looking for some reassurance that maybe one day it\u2019ll all get better or maybe some of your experiences with medications/doctors? I\u2019m also terrified of taking openly and freely about how I feel with doctors. I think seeing a psychiatrist vs my primary will make me be more at ease about it... but I\u2019m still scared I\u2019m going to say something that will get me sent to a padded room or something that will make the doctor think I\u2019m lying. And I feel silly even saying that (I am a nurse after all) but it\u2019s the truth. So just hit me with anything and everything you got please???",

I lost my dream for nothing and I can't ever have it back because it takes the money I cant get realistically again. thinking of my dream actually hurts me emotionally and in a way physically.

I focus on the pain, the only thing that's real. When i am miserable its kind of a compulsion to dig deeper and deeper, feel all the negativity, try to re-enact situations that hurt me deeply over and over again until i am just paralyzed with exhaustion. I am not able to make myself stop doing that unless i am distracting myself with people or work. Otherwise i could take something that's just fine and turn it into something terrible in my head while letting these feelings take over me.",

I started my first year at university this year and, after the mess that was my final year at high school, I\u2019d actually been going quite smoothly for a number of months. The last time I remember harming myself was December of last year.\n\nFast forward to yesterday, and what was supposed to be just a regular day ended up being super painful. I don\u2019t really want to get into the details, but I got home and felt those feelings that I hadn\u2019t felt in a long time. I was so tired and I just wanted to sleep but I couldn\u2019t stop that voice, so I tried hurting myself.\n\nNow, I just feel so ashamed of myself. I\u2019m feeling slightly better in comparison to yesterday because I managed to finally rest and I found my anti-anxiety pills that I hadn\u2019t used in a long time, but now I\u2019m just upset with myself. I thought I\u2019d been going so good, and then I look and see how I\u2019ve responded to yesterday.\n\nHad anyone else had a relapse like this? Does it mean I was never really better? I don\u2019t know how to move on from here",

The one friend I thought I had after I told her I had to get stitches cuz I had tried to end it, she didnt say anything really, after a month she just said shes been busy and sorry for not talking to me, I havnt heard from her since. I havnt talked to anyone or had any interaction with anyone in the last, two months or so, I wish I had friends or someone to hang out with or talk to, I've been such a burden on my family, and I wish I could help them or that I wasnt such a drag on them, if it all ended I know itd be less strain and problems for them, but I k how they'd be sad and I dont want to cause them those problems, I. So lost for what to do but it hurts to keep going",

I just think about all those dreams i had at that time and i just wish, just wish, there was some way to go back and relive it again and if there was someway to change all the painful things that happened after. It was so painful and i lost my mind and life for long time. I guess you could say my dreams.i dont know. I dont want to kill myself or anything. But i just wonder what could i have done differently.

            "selftext": "Dear\u00a0Ryan,\n\nHowever much I digress, please read this email in full, if not out of respect, perhaps out of decency. I hope you enjoyed playing together at Seaford Head today. I understand you probably remember each detail of today, within the realm of recollection when you read this. Despite this, I'll revive the story in it gets lost to the oblivion of time. We played a beautiful round of golf, making beautiful birdies and pars, enjoying the most spectacular views and a terrific lunch of burgers and fries in the clubhouse. Rather than facing another 18 holes in the raging\u00a0wind, we instead headed to the practice green for some chipping and a spot of putting. During this boring time, I missed filming you making the most outrageous trick shot, which I am very sorry for. Eventually, we began playing truth or dare, but after revealing our desired, Clara on your part and Dana\u00eb on mine, we fell silent, or at least stopped. I am ashamed of myself for how I failed to tell you this at that time, but my secret was never revealed. I ought to have returned the honesty you showed me. Before I explain myself further, I'll digress on a slight detour.\u00a0\n\nWe, boys\u00a0 in our class, are but a pack of wolves. Violent, protective and loyal. Invariably, this tribal nature creates dishonesty, as no one reveals their true self for fear of appearing week. This is why I only speak now.\n\n\nMy father cheated on my mother. She most likely doesn't know. No one aside from the perpetrator and his mistress knows. Only I. Solitary in this lethal destiny, called secrecy. I wish I could muster the strength to confront him, but my true self is that of a coward. Instead I turn my back to battle and run, throwing one leg ahead of the other at irreconcilable speed. This path leads me to he, who I should be honest to.\n\nThe evidence is damning. (I'll keep the enclosed evidence private)\n\nFor months I cried, ignored and passed through the next seven stages of depression. How could my father cheat on his wife, who had been loyal and honest for twenty years? How could my father cheat on his wife whose hand he had held as she clung on to dear life after having a seizure? How could my father cheat on my mother, who had been with him through her depression and recovery?\u00a0\n\nIn the month following my discovery, we even went on a road trip along the cote azure. One evening the bastard had the balls to lecture me on love, telling me about how I should live my life. I sure as hell won't make the same mistakes he made. I am sure my father told himself the same lie when his father, my grandfather up and left his mother for a new life when my father was my age.\n\n\nTo be succint, each man is an island, destiny the ocean. It is up to each man to make that discovery during their lifetime.\n\n\nDaddy, daddy, you bastard, I'm through.\n\n\nI'll be damned if this isn't honesty.\n\n\nSincerely,\n\n(/)",

            "selftext": "\nThe gist of it: I\u2019m oversleeping like crazy (I slept until 1:30pm today, when I start work at 3:30) I really need to wash my hair too but I can\u2019t even bring myself to do that. Disassociating all throughout work. Having two coffees and still feeling exhausted. Hands shaking picking up the smallest thing, barely breathing, bumping into things. All I wanted today after work was to smoke some weed and when I couldn\u2019t do that I started looking for my old prescription T3s. Couldn\u2019t find them and realized how fucked up it was that I was even trying. I just want to feel numb at this point. \n\nAfter being awake in bed for 3 hours I started thinking about my boyfriend and just cried. I don\u2019t deserve him. He\u2019s doing so well and does so much for me and all I am is a shell filled with anxiety. I know this and I try to hide it I really do. I want him to be able to focus on other very important things right now without having to worry about my mental wellbeing or feel like he has to take care of me. I know he would because he\u2019s amazing I just feel like such a burden right now. The other day I broke down in the shower and he came in and asked me if I was okay and kept me company and waited until I was done. Just thinking about this now made me feel so bad. Such an intense feeling of guilt like what I try to do for him doesn\u2019t even begin to make up for all that he\u2019s done for me. That\u2019s how I know I\u2019m back in my \u201cvoid\u201d I suppose. \n\nIn case you\u2019re up for reading a wall of text:\n\nI have always struggled with anxiety and depression. Mixed with ADD it does not help. I performed poorly in school from not caring enough and suffered from suicidal thoughts often from 13-15. my parents are split up, they were never actually married. It happened when I wasn\u2019t even a year old. I don\u2019t blame any of my issues on this alone but as a kid you wonder if it was your fault. Often. Going back and forth between houses that rarely communicated with each other resulted in being raised in two completely different parenting styles. Each one had their strengths and weaknesses so again, not blaming that but I think I needed more consistency. I never focused in school, or never cared. Honestly we couldn\u2019t figure out which one it was. I was classified as \u201cgifted\u201d, primarily in math and art. But my processing just wasn\u2019t there. I went for an adhd test when I was about 11, and they said it came back negative. About 4 years later I started seeing a therapist. He also happened to specialize in add/adhd and picked up on a lot of things no one else did. He diagnosed me with add. Things were better, I was taking my meds, doing better in school, and generally just felt safer knowing there was an actual reason I was this way, not something wrong with me. Things were ok for a while and then I started dating a guy 6 years older than me. As a teenager when you get into that it\u2019s hard to focus on anything else. Long story short he used me (for that) cheated on me and ghosted me pretending he was just too busy with work. First relationship at 17 so that fucked me up. I met the wonderful man I am now with just two months after that. We\u2019ve been together for over 2 years and it has been the best 2 years of my life. I still have not obtained my high school diploma and am trying to work on that to better myself for myself but also for him. This particular night/morning I\u2019m feeling a lot of doubt like I\u2019m not good enough for him. I\u2019ve always been an  emotional person and he just deals with it so well. I wonder how long it will take for him to get tired of that. I\u2019m starting to think he deserves better than me, that I don\u2019t deserve to be treated as well as he has because of where I am and what little I\u2019ve accomplished. I really trust him I do and I want to bring this up to him but my anxiety in the back of my mind is screaming at me. What if I tell him this and he\u2019s like actually yeah you\u2019re right. This is how I know it\u2019s not real and it\u2019s my depression talking but it\u2019s just so overwhelming.",

            "selftext": "Alright, so this is very tough to talk about but I need to surround myself with people that understand. My boyfriend of almost four years and I broke up a few days ago, we were having a wonderful life in a city we were living in for a year. We occasionally fought, but when we did it got pretty emotional. I don\u2019t doubt he loves me or that I love him, but I became very hard to deal with. He of course had his flaws, but for a pretty mentally healthy person it was difficult for him to understand my depression.  He had his struggles with getting his career started in this city, mostly out of laziness, but also because he likes the easy way out.  No matter how objectively I can see this break up, I can\u2019t fight the depressive aspect of it, I\u2019m heartbroken, helpless, and pretty fucking lonely. I\u2019ve battled with depression since I was a kid, at first everyone thought it was me being an angsty teen but later on in life it became very apparent that this is just what I struggle with. Moments when our relationship got harder I would go to a place of sulking and sadness. Instead of being the strong woman I am, I\u2019d cry without hesitation. That got old pretty quick but I couldn\u2019t control it. I NEVER cry in front of anyone aside from this partner or my family. It\u2019s even difficult for me to get emotional in really sad situations. He has been kind of a dick about the whole thing, which is his way of coping, it always has been. For me, I\u2019ve just been crying a lot, isolating, and losing soooo much sleep. He was my support system whenever anything happened in my life, but I know I need to cut ties. He blamed me for being \u201cmiserable\u201d when we were together, which isn\u2019t the case. I was very happy with our lives, I just needed understanding from his end. The reality is that I need meds, I\u2019ve done everything to try to feel better but nothing works. I have a few questions for the depression community. I\u2019d like to understand how some of you cope with tough break ups when you\u2019re also at the worse of your depression. How involved are your partners when you\u2019re having a mental breakdown ? Should I expect my future partner to always be there for me when I\u2019m going through the worse ? And how is it for the people around you that don\u2019t deal with the depression ? Are they understanding and loving or do they pull away ? Also if you have any medication reviews and warnings, I\u2019m going to a psychiatrist tomorrow to figure out what\u2019s the best med for me.",

I slept for probably 12 hours on Tuesday and Wednesday. Now I don't want to go to sleep because then I know I'll have to wake up and continue existing. I feel like I'm just going through the motions day in and day out. Even when I try to do something fun I think about how I don't deserve to be having fun and should just leave. I hate this, all of this. \n\nI dunno. I guess I just wanted to vent a little bit. I can't even feel emotion after typing all of that out even though it's what I'm feeling and thinking.

The depression was so much that I rarely felt happiness then. I also had family issues but I\u2019m not talking about that here. I was depressed and angry most of the time. That was almost all I felt from elementary school to intermediate school.  I also had paranoid thoughts of other students for a long time. Thoughts that they wouldn\u2019t like me or they were better than me. I was very lonely but to shy/paranoid to make many friends. I didn\u2019t really talk to many other kids because of this. I was always terrified at school and on high alert. It was the worst! I also was kind of isolating myself as a child in my room a lot. Also because of my sibling who treated me horribly but I\u2019m not getting in to details about that. So It was very hard being isolated while other kids played Outside. I thought Something was wrong with me that I felt this way. I thought I didn\u2019t deserve friend cause I was weird. Also Then I started having manic episodes around high school. Also I got to a point where I was so paranoid I called the police.. on my brother because I though he was a person breaking in. I even got some people in high school in trouble because I was so paranoid.. that they were talking about me. I hope I never get to this state again it really is a horrible place.. Alright so with the manic episodes I started being super hyper!! I couldn\u2019t stop talking to my family. I was like bouncing off the walls with energy. So yeah I don\u2019t even know what I really have..",

            "selftext": "Hey all, sorry but this is going to be a bit of a long post. I also don't know where this goes, so I'm posting it in r/overcoming, r/depression and r/Anxiety.\n\nI'm currently 17 (m), so forgive all of the immature shit that I'm going to say in this post that you'll laugh at. I've been diagnosed with clinical depression for three years now, however my psychologist thinks that I could've had it as long as 5. I've also been diagnosed with clinical anxiety, and may be checked soon for OCD because of past years.\n\nTo explain why, I'm going to pop back to primary school (I said this was going to be a long post, sorry again). I don't want this to brag, but in primary school, I excelled far past all of my classmates. Not to the point of being a prodigy, but in early years we had these reading levels. The next best student in the three years above me and in my year got to reading level 22, and I got to 37 (basically reading small 100 page novels with complex language in reception). This carried on throughout primary school. I would consistently mess around in class, and would come out every term with straight A's, apart from the occasional B in a subject that I messed around too much in.\n\nNear the end of Year 4 (I'm Australian so I don't know what year this is for other countries, I was turning 10 that year), my principal called a meeting with my parents and me, and we came to the agreement that I should skip Year 5. To prove that I was capable, I had to take part in the Year 5 Exhibition, which is basically a large group project that is displayed in the gym at the end of the year. It takes a term to complete, and a lot of research in comparison to anything that we'd done before. However, my group was lovely, and I put in a bit of time, and we came out with an A.\n\nThe next year, I walked into my Year 6 class as a 10-year-old with two of my best mates, not knowing that this was the start of my fall into depression. Year 6 was not significantly harder than year 5, but I missed out on a few base lessons, maths and some language. The minor increase, however, was just enough to buck me off of my high horse. Suddenly, instead of being able to bring home consistent A's, it was an equal mix of A's and B's, with the occasional C. Year 6 also had a big project at the end of the year, called SIP (Student Independent Project, or something like that). It was basically a small research project, marked out of 20, and had many different aspects to consider. I did mine on coding, seeing how I could implement drug education into other platforms, such as games or online courses. Being the smart child I was, I spent a week on the project, and had a great final project at the end. However, you needed way more than just a final project to ace the SIP, you needed a journal of your progress, and you needed to focus in class, something that I was horrible at. I came home with a C+, and forgot about it, marking it off as another stupid project that I didn't need to worry about. The next year, I made the decision to enter into a private school in Year 7, which wasn't the norm at the time.\n\nThe school was an Early Learning - Year 12 school, so almost all of my year knew each other already. There were only 5 of us that joined from other schools. However, my childish idiocy allowed me to find a friendship group quickly. I was so energetic and careless that people didn't care if I was a year younger than them. That year was the first year where I actually had to (sort of) pay attention in class. If I focused on an assignment I could get an A, but because I wasn't used to having to focus, there was a portion of assignments that never got handed in, because I always saw ease as more important than effort.\n\nIn Year 9, I got into my first relationship, with a girl who I'll call Sasha. We were horrible for each other. I was an idiot who wasn't in touch with my emotions and already had a few early signs of a growing depression, caused by hanging out with the wrong people and talking about the wrong things. She was beautiful, and had OCD, but was looking for a guy who would be physically compassionate, and would kiss her and love her like she wanted. I realised two years later that I was asexual (I now define myself as graysexual, meaning that I only very rarely feel any kind of sexual attraction). The relationship was a mess. As my mental state slowly declined, and I began to feel heavily suicidal, she wanted to comfort me, but at the same time, was wanting someone who she didn't have. We mutually (more her than me) decided to break it off, and she moved schools the next year (because of other reasons, I wasn't that bad back then).\n\nAfter she left, I fell even deeper into my depressive state. I spent a lot of my time thinking about suicide, and was generally unsatisfied in my life. My eating and exercise were almost nonexistant, which lead to me being a late bloomer, which caused a lot of insecurities later. In Year 10, I went on a school trip to Japan, which marked a positive change in my life. I spent most of my time hanging around a group of girls, as I've always preferred hanging around them (I realise now that it's because guys are generally far more open about sexual feelings, which I could never relate to, whereas girls are much more emotional, which I could very easily relate to). I was close friends with one of the girls on the trip because of our problems with eating, and was generally a lot less miserable. On one of the last nights of the trip, I left my hotel to get a drink and found one of the girls crying, because one of her close friends had recently begun to experiment with drugs. For the sake of her privacy, we'll call her Violet. I comforted her, and we sat and talked, each sharing our feeling and worries.\n\nViolet was lovely, a pansexual social activist who taught me a lot about myself. She helped me get rid of a lot of the toxic behaviour that I had before (using gay and retarded as insults, being a generally shit person as was the norm at my school in that year), and was one of the stepping stones that led me to realising that I wasn't totally straight (I call myself bisexual now, but am more pansexual). She left school at the end of the year, moving because her mother had a good job offer interstate. I didn't realise but she had a crush on me at the time, but nothing came of it.\n\nThe next year, I started Drama, and quickly grew to love the class. My classmates were lovely and the lessons were engaging. My friends were doing good, and it seemed like everything was going right. Although my grades were falling off, as I was handing less and less work.\n\nWe did our first production for the year in May, and it was amazing. I was nervous as fuck, almost having a breakdown because the stress triggered some of my symptoms (part of the reason that I'm getting checked for OCD). The production was stupid, a rip-off of High School Musical, but it was fun, I was one of the leads, and the group had really come together for it. In one of the scenes I was supposed to get kneed in the balls, and it was choreographed so that I wouldn't get hit, but in the adrenaline rush of the night, the other lead didn't pull back quite enough. I pushed through it, and we finished the production. After we had all gone home, she texted me to say sorry, and we started talking. Let's call her Anna.\n\nWe organised to see a movie together, and after that, we went for a walk. We talked about a lot of stuff, but ended up realising that we both had feelings for each other. After two days, I had asked her out, and had began to hang out with her inbetween lessons. I planned to split my time between her and my friends, and since her group was primarily made up of drama kids, I was able to fit in just fine.\n\nWe went into the city for our first date, so that I could take her to one of my favourite cafes. We had an awkward first kiss, and left holding hands. I had told her that I was suicidal, as I had many insecurities and my last relationship had left me feeling like I was a burden and that my feelings were the same. She said she didn't care, and that we'd do our best together. She struggled with some body dysmorphia, and was asexual too, so we both had our issues, but we could help each other to figure them out.\n\nMy sleeping, eating and exercising habits were extremely off at this point, and after having a week where I ate a total of 2 pieces of toast and nothing else, I decided to go to a doctor. At the doctor, I told her about how I was feeling at the time, and I begun to see a psychologist. She helped a lot, and with new friends, a supportive girlfriend and the beginnings of something near mental stability, my grades started to improve, going back to A's and B's. I spent my holidays partying, as Violet came back every holiday and hosted a party for a group of people, which included Anna and me.\n\nI started Year 12 the next year, (this year) and the work got considerably harder. My feelings of hopelessness came back, and my grades started to fall. This causes an endless cycle, where I would just continually get worse and worse. I ended up having to drop two of my classes, hoping that I could complete two instead of failing four. My anxiety and depression worsened, and my sleep got even worse. By July, I was going to bed at 6am, and waking up at 5pm, meaning that I couldn't go to school. I knew it was bad, but I didn't know how to stop it. I wasn't able to hang out with Anna, and by this point we were nearing out 13th anniversary. Every time we talked, it would begin good, but by the end of it, she'd be telling me that I needed to fix my sleep.\n\nThis didn't work, as I just felt horrible. I begun to slowly feel worse and worse about myself. I wasn't seeing my old friends anymore, as by the time I wanted to hang out with them, they'd transitioned from jokey, lovely people, to jokey, lovely people who partied and got drunk every weekend. I wasn't seeing anyone, and was effectively cut off, as my sleep didn't allow it. I was able to make a party every once in a while, but I still felt so external, as if I wasn't really supposed to be there, and no-one wanted me there.\n\nI didn't know what to do. My relationship had become me struggling with mental health, and my girlfriend getting annoyed at me for it. I begun to take breaks, going offline for a couple days at a time, because the relationship wasn't doing me any good, but I still wanted it. She was understandably annoyed, and we started to fight more. I started to feel more and more suicidal, as it seemed like I had spent my life doing nothing and was going to waste the rest of it doing the same.\n\nThis brings us to two weeks ago. We were calling, and it seemed like everything was fine. However, as normal, it turned quickly into me having to apologise for my depression. I hung up, and begun another period of radio silence. I spent the entire time contemplating suicide and a breakup, neither of which were things that I wanted.\n\nI've never been someone who can easily talk about their emotions. After Sasha, I had spent two years pretending as if I was fine, and this led to me preferring to hide my emotions instead of talk about them. I didn't, and still don't, know how to tell Anna how much she hurt me. How am I supposed to tell her that her joking and questioning made me feel like I was the problem? Like I was the one ruining our relationship and my life.\n\nThat last period of radio silence lasted a week. One week of ignoring every text and call. I know, it's abusive and horrible, but I was so confused, and hurt. I'm not trying to make excuses, I'm just saying that I didn't know what else to do. It ended when she showed up at my house.\n\nWe talked for two hours. Talked is a bit generous. By the time that she had started talking, I had made my decision. If we were to breakup, which I thought we needed to, as it wasn't working for either of us, I might as well make it easy for her.\n\nIf we breakup, I don't want her to suffer. I want her to get over it as quickly as possible. So, how do I do that. I make her hate me. I make her want to murder me. I make her want me to kill myself in the many ways that I'd already thought of.\n\nNeedless to say, it wasn't a nice conversation. I didn't want to say the words myself, so I made her say them for me. I was horrible to her throughout. I ignored her and told her to fuck off the whole time, pretending as if I didn't give a single shit, all the time wanting to kill myself.\n\nShe broke up with me after that, heartbroken and crying. I went on watching my youtube video, trying my best to shove down the horrible thoughts I was having and the emotions I was feeling. I knew there was no coming back from that. I had just behaved like the worst person to ever exist, but I knew it would be the best for her. Sure enough, within a week, the texts have turned from 'I miss us', 'Why can't be together again' to 'You were abusive and horrible' and 'You'll never have to talk to me again'. However, this has also led to our entire friendship group despising me. I understand why, but I am so alone right now, and all I need is to be with people, but I can't. Just a few days ago, Violet hosted the first party in two years that I wasn't invited to. I have three parties that I was going to go to this month, but Anna's going to all of them, and how am I supposed to go? Everyone there will hate me, and I'll just have to sit there and pretend as if they don't.\n\nThere are only four people that are treating me like I'm still human now. Everyone has heard her side of the story, about me being an abusive dickhead who treated her like shit and didn't even care. And I did that. I know full well that I did that.  But I don't want to be alone anymore. I don't want to keep on waking up and realising that there is nothing left for me to do. I can sink my hours into mindless videos, or video games that mean nothing, but why?\n\nI think about killing myself at least once every 5 minutes. I have multiple plans, but I don't want to. I still love Anna, and I want my friends back. I want to be happy again, at least once before I go. But I don't know how. I'm sitting at my desk, crying while in a call with a mate of mine. I'm keeping it quiet so he can't hear me over the game that he's playing, that I'm about to join him on. All the while I'm wondering how painful it could possibly be to slit your wrists and bleed out.\n\nIt can't be worse than this. This quiet suffering. This seemingly endless life that I don't want to live. This time and money that I've wasted by not killing myself years ago.\n\nHow do I fix this? Or is it better to just go? Just get it over with?\n\nThankyou to anyone who took the time to read this. I don't even care if no-one answers. I just need to talk and for someone to listen. Or even just for someone to treat me like I'm still human.\n\nTL;DR: Success in early childhood led to lack of effort in later schooling. Caused recent breakup and don't know how to fix it, or whether I should just kill myself.",

            "selftext": "6 weeks ago, I started taking 10mg of Lexapro mainly for anxiety, but also depression. The first week was horrible, and filled with anxiety, but I was motivated to get through it because I was told it gets better. After the first week, I gradually felt better and less anxious. However, I noticed I had some sexual side effects. Therefore, on the 6th week I decided to start taking Wellbutrin (150mg SR once/day, morning), as I read that it can actually increase libido and reverse some of the negative side effects of SSRI's. Another argument for taking Wellbutrin was that it increases the effect of the combined SSRI, which is good, since I was considering upping my dose of Lexapro otherwise. \n\nI'm now on day 3 of Wellbutrin, and I feel pretty bad. My anxiety is through the roof. I feel like I'm always on edge. The anxiety is more of a body anxiety than a mind anxiety, meaning that the worst part of it is the burning sensation in my entire body. Also, I still haven't felt any increase in libido or other high-dopamine related effects. Like an SSRI, does your body need time to get used to Wellbutrin? Will my Wellbutrin related anxiety go away after a while of taking it? If you guys could share your knowledge/ experiences with Wellbutrin, or even Wellbutrin and Lexapro combined, I'd really appreciate to hear what you have to say.",

Didn\u2019t think I had depression until the month before I graduated college in 2017. My grandma (who was like my 2nd mom) passed away the week of my finals and I was surprised I even passed. After graduation, I just didn\u2019t know what to do with my life. My grandma\u2019s death hit me hard that I isolated myself to my room and just played video games. Stupid mistake on my end. During that, I developed tension headaches to the point that I thought I was going crazy and couldn\u2019t think. 2018 was just basically me going back and forth to the ER. Meds were given, and I felt somewhat better but it didn\u2019t take away the dread and confusion in what I would do with my life. Applying to jobs and no success to getting any job offers has been a big trigger to my depression as well as my tension headaches (yay :/) and I\u2019m at a point where I just feel like I\u2019m a useless person to my loved ones. I\u2019m at an age where I should be already stable with an income and paying a mortgage on a house (by cultural standards I guess) but I\u2019m not, and it\u2019s stressing me out that I can\u2019t get anywhere without a job at the moment. I feel like I failed myself down the line and depression, anxiety, tension headaches and stress are  the results from my failures. I\u2019m not sure where to go from here but only thing I am doing is still trying to get a job even though the process is making me anxious and stressed. I just wanted to write how I\u2019m feeling at the moment. If you read this, thanks for looking at my story.",

It\u2019s natural for males to seek attention and validation from females. But its also disharding and shattering being unwanted. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m dying to take take part of the ongoing \u201chookup culture\u201d. I just want someone to be there for me n vice versa.\n\nSeeing and hearing about how your fellow males slay the world around them. Makes yourself insecure even you can\u2019t even get a date let alone a tinder match. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m socially awkward or extremely ugly. I just became sort of a loner. It\u2019s lowkey harder to make friends when everyone has already established their social circles. I like meeting new people usually involves me going clubbing alone. I often just stand somewhere and enjoy the scenery and dance when a great song gets on. I kinda accepted that I might\u2019ve become that loser that everyone talks about, but hey why should i be bothered by people who don\u2019t really know me. I used to be class clown so I kinda find it funny that the tables has turned. \n\n Thank you for reading my little rant about my current situation and struggles. Have a great day \ud83d\ude01",

            "selftext": "TL;DR: need to go off my antidepressant temporarily, and looking for advice/support. \n\nI\u2019m on citalopram (SSRI) for depression and anxiety. \n\nI\u2019m going to do a sleep study in about 5 weeks. I was told for optimal results I need to be off of citalopram for two weeks prior to the exam. The doctor recommended taking two weeks (so a month out from the study) to taper off, going from 20 mg, to 15, to 10, to 5, to 5 every other day, then 0. \n\nI\u2019ve been on citalopram for about 6-7 years. I tried to go off after the first year or so and nose-dived in a lot of ways. I behaved (in hindsight) erratically, and made out of character decisions. \n\nI want to safely go into this, unlike last time, where I went rogue and just decided I was healthy on my own (lol). I\u2019m thinking about scheduling something with my PCP beforehand, and upping my therapist visits in frequency (from every two weeks to perhaps every week, then maybe twice a week the two weeks I\u2019m completely off). Any other ideas? \n\nI\u2019m honestly pretty scared. I\u2019ve heard there\u2019s some research that suggests going off medication can make depression get worse than it ever was. I\u2019m also nervous because I\u2019ve been trying to find a birth control that works well with my body, and I\u2019m still in the early stages of a new hormonal pill. Anxiety and mood swings have been a side effect. \n\nI\u2019m also on Nortriptyline for Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (primarily for muscle pain), but I know it also acts as an antidepressant. I\u2019m allowed to stay on that until 24 hours prior to my study. \n\nI guess I\u2019m looking for some hand holding and support. If there are any red flags here,etc me know. The sleep specialist said it would be great to test without, but if I\u2019m not able to function well without it I can stay on it. My plan is to try, but have going back on as a fallback. \n\nIs it ok that I\u2019m scared? I feel like I\u2019ve been keeping monsters at bay by being on medication. What if I lose myself when I go off?",

            "selftext": "My sister hates confrontation with a burning passion so usually if something bothers her, she pushes it way back until eventually everything falls apart and all of her feelings come out at once. Today she did that (mostly because she was drugged up after a c section). \n\nWe were sitting, talking about my niece, when she asked me if she could rant about our mom. She thinks I love our mom and wouldn\u2019t ever want to talk bad about her, but that\u2019s not exactly true. I told her to go ahead and she brought up the one thing that hurts the most: my weight. More specifically, how our mom deals with our weight. \n\nOur mom constantly calls us fat and ugly. She always says we eat too much (even though we don\u2019t. My sister and I both average about 1 1/2 meals a day because of how little we eat. We just have metabolism and thyroid problems). And every time we eat, with each bite, she will get more and more angry until after maybe 20 bites she says, \u201cif you keep eating that much, you\u2019re going to get as big as a house.\u201d It\u2019s been like this our whole lives. \n\nMy sister brought this up, saying my mom had talked about my niece\u2019s weight and how they will need to watch her food intake because she will end up like us. This brought back so much. It was like there was a door I forgot was there and when I went to check what was behind it, everything inside the room poured out and fell on top of me. In that moment I felt suffocated.\n\nI recently moved out way before I was financially ready because I couldn\u2019t be in the same house as my mom anymore. I tried to block her but I couldn\u2019t because it felt wrong. Somewhere inside me, I love her. I don\u2019t know why. She\u2019s extremely abusive. But even after I moved out, I\u2019m always worried who will know when I get fast food, who will know when I\u2019ve gained a pound, and who will know if I\u2019ve had seconds.\n\nAnd in the hospital, where I was supposed to be celebrating my niece, I just sat there crying. Crying at the idea of my niece thinking she\u2019s fat. My niece finding comfort in food. Her taking up binge eating. Her binging for days then starving for a day to try and even it out. Her worrying about what her grandma thinks. Her getting to her teenage years and wanting to die rather than control her eating habits. I couldn\u2019t stop crying. \n\nI don\u2019t want her to become me. But it seems unavoidable with my mom being the way she is. Today has been tough, partially because of my worry for my niece, but mostly because of a reminder about who my mom really is. A woman who hates fat people",

I just wish he could hold me again while I told him all my fears and feelings. He's gone and happier that i'm no longer a part of his life and he won't dignify it with an answer.\n\nOne time I tried a self stabbing, a ton of self harm, then I shared a document where I wrote my feelings and fears again and he called the cops on me... \n\nOne of the few fucking times in my life I felt genuinely happy for being myself, didn't feel lonely and don't worry, the luxury is only a memory.

I\u2019ve told my mom that I\u2019ve tried to hurt myself and that I think about suicide everyday. I told her that I want to get on medication and see a therapist and her first thought was how much it would cost and that we couldn\u2019t do it right now. I have textbook signs of depression and I feel like anyone with eyes should notice. I am a walking red flag for someone who is not doing well and needs help and it\u2019s honestly hilarious to me that not 1 person in my life has made any effort to even ask me how I am. I don\u2019t understand how you could hear your only child say \u201cI\u2019m suicidal I\u2019m so depressed I need something in my life to change\u201d and watch them display signs of depression and treat it like I said I had a stomachache.",

            "selftext": "A lot of shit has been going on recently and i cant handle it. I feel like everyone i know and everyone that is around me utterly hates me, which is probably the case. I feel so much hatred towards myself and i wish i could  disappear or be someone else. Everyone around me is happy, everyone around me has  friends, a girlfriend/boyfriend and overall a life. All of my so called friends just use me for my money. None of them care about me. The ones that don't use me never talk to me and when they do they sound annoyed. Everyone knows me as that annoying kid, because i am. I was diagnosed with ADHD and no one knows that, the few that do just pity me. My family hates me, and my mother recently found out i smoke weed. I smoke it so i could have a chance to escape my living hell, but now i think she sees me as a disappointment. I haven't amounted to anything, ive never made anyone proud, im just that annoying useless dude that you could freeload off because he doesn't have any friends. I genuinely hate my life and want to end it but im too scared to. Im afraid that there will be an afterlife and the pain just simply continues there. Im afraid that if i take my life, ill be looked down upon even more. I just want someone real. Someone who is there for me and doesn't just use me. Someone who doesn't think im annoying and genuinely likes talking to me. Someone who wont switch up behind my back and end up fucking me over. Im tired of  my shitty life and ive been considering ending it for so long. Weed is like my life support right now. Once i get high i leave this shitty state of mind and my shitty life, the when it wears off, im back. I hate myself so much and i dont know what to do with all this anger and pain. Im useless and im never going to be loved or make anyone proud. I suck at school, I suck at my hobbies, and I suck at everything i do. Therapy is useless and I know the only reason i get listened to by my therapist is because of that fat fucking pay check. I hatae my life and i just want a real genuine hug from a person that cares. I want for real friends and a girlfriend, but im never going to get that  which is something ill have to accept. If you read all of this venting bullshit, i appreciate it. I hope your day/night goes great and thank you so much for listening.",

            "selftext": "I went through a difficult breakup 4 months ago. I started the relationship at a wrong time because I had only been on my own for a couple of months. I've struggled with self-esteem issues since I was a kid, most likely because I was bullied. I developed an attachment to this guy, but he on the other hand had been alone for 17 years so he wasn't on the same page with me. I tried to get close to him, but he wouldn't let me and I started to fear I'd lose him. I'm always afraid I'm not enough. He then broke up with me after three months. It was enough time for me to fall for him.\n\nI sent him a million stupid messages and he blocked me. Now we're working on being friends, but he doesn't want a relationship because \"he saw enough\". I told him that the timing was bad, I admitted I was unhealthily attached and I showed him all my weaknesses. It's killing me that this issue I've struggled with all my life ruined this relationship. I can't forgive myself for that and I absolutely hate this quality in me, because had I been stronger and confident, he'd still be here. Now I'm just a basket case to him and he'll never trust me again. All I've done is grovel and ask him to stay. He'll never want a person like that, but that's who I apparently am now.\n\nHe didn't like the way I often defended myself etc. I know I do this sometimes. He's always \"watching what he says\" because he doesn't want people to get defensive, anger anyone or be misunderstood. It takes him forever to formulate a response to just about anything, if he even responds. He does this with everyone because he has studied psychology and has apparently worked with a lot of people with cognitive issues or something and has learned to be this way. This is one of the reasons I couldn't seem to connect with him. He also always gave roundabout answers to everything.\n\nI just hate myself for being so broken. I don't want to be so broken. It keeps messing things up for me and I keep pushing people away. I wish I could've been normal, but I can't change it and it's breaking me apart. I hate to be so pitiful and weak.",

I have an awesome memory its like, eidetic and wonderful and has never failed me in my life its fricken a tedious little memory filing cabinet. \n\nB. I have THE MOST important **career interview** of my life Tuesday. Do I bring notes? Is that appropriate? I\u2019ve been trying to get into this place for 12 years. Do you know how many job applications that is? Do I write out my answers to questions they may have or words I like? Do I study a thesaurus and if I do, will I remember what I read? Do I tell them? Will that look worse? Oh frig. The interview is after my second treatment (day after it not day of) and like, what if I can\u2019t remember anything I do for a living because my brain is a bottle of fudge?! The universe is cruel. \n\nPlease help me. If you started to experience memory loss - was it 1 or 2 treatments in? I have read so many things and I\u2019m just terrified.",

My heart is broken. I feel like a cannon ball has ripped through my stomach. I see her almost daily and we only talk when it pertains to our work. I wish I could tell her how I feel but I know how she is and she doesn\u2019t talk about her feelings so I can\u2019t tell her how much it hurts. This is going to sound horrible, but whenever we\u2019d talk I couldn\u2019t help but smile because of the joy she brought me. Now I can\u2019t even look at her because it\u2019s just too hard. I can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s disgust or what but I can\u2019t put it into words. I just can\u2019t look anymore.\n\nIm rambling at this point and my mind is muddled but this has just been eating at me something awful and I just needed to say it.

Its the same exact cycle. I get constipated, im super anxious and depressed and I always feel like breaking down. Then i give myself the runs and then i feel amazing. I feel happy again. I feel energized. I can see the beauty in life and i have all my motivation. I feel good for a bit until get constipated again. And then I go back to panic attacks and depression. I got put on zoloft a few months ago and its been helping but its still not a fun time at all. I'm going to the doctor tomorrow. Does this happen to anyone else? Is there a reason why being constipated can affect my mood this much?",

            "selftext": "Hi- \n\nI\u2019ve been depressed pretty much my entire life. When I was younger and living at home I had my parents to keep me in check in terms of personal hygiene and stuff like that, but now I live alone in NYC (my 5th year here) and I can see myself slipping farther and farther from that. When I have episodes they last months and I completely neglect myself. I haven\u2019t been to a gym in years, I barely eat and when I do it\u2019s cheap food because I have hardly any money. Sometimes I don\u2019t shower for weeks and don\u2019t brush my teeth, I buy small amounts of groceries but then I just don\u2019t eat them and let them sit in my fridge until they spoil and I throw them out. When I feel good enough to cook, a rare occasion, I let my dishes pile up for weeks. There\u2019s not even that many since I live alone. Literally just 6 are sitting on my counter now and I\u2019m staring at them. I forget to do my laundry so I sleep in my dirty sheets and I wear the same clothes all the time when I do leave the house. I feel good when I shower but I feel like my apartment is such a gross depfession den that I\u2019m dirty just by being in it and I don\u2019t ever feel fully clean. It doesn\u2019t help that I\u2019ve been having structural issues with my apartment (I live on the ground floor), my ceiling caved in,half the time my toilet doesn\u2019t work, and I lose electricity sometimes so that\u2019s stressful too. \nI feel like a disgusting human being. I am a  young woman who could be pretty if I actually could be arsed to try but I feel dirty and repulsive on the inside. I completely ignore myself and go to university for 7 hours a day (I go to a design school and do patternmaking for fashion design, so it\u2019s a lot of working with my hands and small details, I find it enjoyable but exhausting and I spend all this time thinking about clothes and style that I don\u2019t have the energy to dress myself properly) \n\nI have no idea where to start changing this and how I could make it a lasting impact VS. just another really nice shower and tidy up that gets ruined in two days when I go downhill again. I don\u2019t have a significant other and I have a few friends but I\u2019m so busy that nobody comes over, so I have nothing keeping me in check. I feel like my apartment is chronically dirty, even if I spend all day cleaning it still feels dirty to me. I don\u2019t like to walk barefoot in my own apartment and I even wear shower shoes, my shower is completely fine and clean but for some reason I feel like everything I own is covered in a film of neglect and disgust. Yet I sit in it and do nothing. \nPlease, if you have any advice for me let me know. It\u2019s making me really, really sad. I want to feel pretty and clean and like I can enjoy the place I live fully and it seems completely impossible right now.",

Making friends, making money, finding a gf.. everything.\n\nI am 24 and yet I am never even held hands with a girl. I am ugly as shit and I repulse everyone. All I have left after all these years of pain and suffering is a little bit of hope for a better life but I am coming around to the idea that it's just false hope. My life is pointless.

            "selftext": "I took a life. This is all that goes through my mind everyday. 3 years ago I started doing a bunch of drugs and was in a toxic relationship, not that this justifies anything I did, but I was so fueled with anger all the time. There was this kid, a quiet kid that always kept to himself, didnt have any friends, always sat alone, that kind of kid, he bumped into me one day, that's all it was, him bumping into me and I blew up on him. I told him all these cruel things and just completely releasing on him. Spring break happened and I carried on like it was nothing not thinking about it until spring break ended and I learned the next day after I said what I said he put a shotgun to his mouth and took his life. I killed this man. It was me. I am a murderer. This fucked me up bad and I acted like it was nothing but deep down I hated what I had become. I took it out on my on and off girlfriend for a year making her feel worthless and unneeded. It got to a point where she was afraid of men completely. I would leave her just to watch her try to get back with me because it made me feel needed. She wont even look in my direction anymore. She loved me more than anyone ever will again. I upped the dosage and up the dosage and got worse and worse. Nothing made it better. I like to think my mom was to blame. I blame her for a lot of things. The way she used, I became no better than her. I'm your son, all I had was you and you abandoned me, now everyone does because of the person I've became. Shitty thing after shitty thing, and the worse part is I dont even feel bad about it anymore. That kid doesn't have to worry about the next shitty thing I'll do, I'm the one who has to live with that. I am the biggest victim of the actions of myself. I have to think about it every day. I cant go a day without sedating the thoughts in my head. Somedays I dont even want to get out of bed anymore, I savor those moments where I'm so far gone I dont even know who I am. I left my dad to join the army because he was dying and I didn't want to witness it. I thought maybe if I left, those thoughts would go away. I'm about to live a thousand miles away, and everything is worse now.",

            "selftext": "*Sorry for the huge block of text, I just want somewhere to write my feelings down.\n\nI've been depressed for pretty much my while life. I can remember as early as 6 years old being that way. I was bullied in school and felt like I didn't ever fit in (being a foreigner didn't help). I can remember times in high school where the only reason I would even get out of bed in the morning was because I was thirsty or needed to go to the bathroom. I made it to the age of 18 with no friends and I was so incredibly miserable, lonely and depressed.\n\nLast year was my first year of university. It was a very difficult year for me. I got really depressed at the beginning ot the school year and had problems with my antidepressants and couldn't see a doctor so I had to stop taking them. I spent two weeks with really bad withdrawals and missed so much class that I was behind for the whole year and failed a couple courses. This also made me feel stupid compared to other people in my program. Despite everything that went wrong, I got so much better last year. I made friends for the first time, got so much mire confident and less anxious, and felt more in my element than I ever did in school.\n\nOver the summer I went to a therapist, and she was really nice. Now that uni has started again, I've been more organised with my time and also been getting together with the friends I've made over the last year. Today  I came to the realization that I deserve to be in my program just as much as anyone else, and I am every bit as smart as they are. Just because they say things are easy, doesn't mean that's true.\n\nI've also found something that makes me really happy, which is ballroom dancing/jive. I was too anxious to go out to the classes last year but this week I gathered up the courage to go to a class and I had the most fun I've had since I can remember. I cannot wait until the next class, and having something to look forward to is such a great feeling, especially after years of not having anything like that.\n\nI still have bad days, days where I just want to crawl into bed and never come out, days when I can hardly muster up the energy to leave the house or even eat. I'm still depressed, but I know that there's a light at the end of the tunnel and I am so grateful for that. \n\nIf anyone is reading this and feels hopeless, please know that things do get better. It might take a few weeks or months, or maybe even 19 years, but there is always hope.",

(Which is kinda obvious - im just a job)\n\n\nRecently I get reminded of that *every time* I leave the clinic - I've been going to that doc almost every single day since August due to reasons im too lazy to type. Before that I used to visit only for my med refills, in and out within 2 mins literally Lmao.\n\n\n\n I feel so fucking sad when feeling at least one single person in this world 'cares' about me then logic hits right after. Lol I'm fucking lonely to the point where I get attached to a fucking doctor Lmao\n\n\nLike just now, I literally almost cried on the busride home after visiting the clinic. Ofc I don't want to cry in public so my eyes were in that blurry state and the second I step into my place, tears everywhere lmao\n\n\nIt especially feels more depressing cuz I learned about the consequences of over-attachment the hard way not so long ago. (In short: went to grad school, finally felt I belonged somewhere, and then shit happened and I had to leave the lab. And no one even said a goodbye. That hurt more than losing my dream, or the equivalent amount at the very least.\n\n\n\nI have no one else to properly socialize with, not even my family, zero friends. I think I tend to cling to anyone who is the least bit friendly to me, regardless of circumstances or if it's just social manner or not.\n\n\nI think I need to stop going to my current doc. Maybe I'll simply tell the reason as a courtesy or not mention anything and stop going altogether. \n\n\nShould I change to another psychiatrist? Though it's kind of a headache to find another one as there just aren't enough psych medical professionals where I live, the one I'm going now is essentially the *only* one that can be legit called a 'psychiatric clinic' close to my residence.\n\n\nShe's my 5th shrink and so far the most helpful imo. Idk enough about mental health treatments to know if it's finally working or not. \n\n\n\nShould I stay w my current one or should I go to someone else and rely soley on meds like before?",

            "selftext": "Hey,\n\nI have pretty severe major depressive disorder. Always have. Since I was a tiny child who didn't even know what depression is. I have kind of an embarrassing question for all of you. I am wondering if anyone else is like this. My depression is so severe that I have uncontrollable crying spells that always happen at the worst possible times. Before I left my office job I would just sit there at my desk crying the entire day while trying to work. As a child, I had to leave school and become homeschooled because I could not emotionally handle being in a school environment for this same reason. Sometimes the crying spells are triggered by a specific thought (i.e. grief over deceased loved ones) and sometimes not. I work from home because it doesn't matter if I'm crying all day and I don't have to worry about being embarrassed or making other people uncomfortable. \n\nI have tried all the antidepressants and been through all different types of therapy to no avail. This is just genetically how I am because most people in my family are severely depressed too. \n\n\nCan anyone relate?",

            "selftext": "My parents always told me that college is **the best years of your life.** That\u2019s the biggest load of bullshit I\u2019ve ever heard.\n\nIt\u2019s Thursday night, and I\u2019m home alone. If these are the best years of my life, what\u2019s the point in living?\n\nIf you\u2019re lucky enough to not have a Friday class, you\u2019ll be out partying, or on a date, getting wasted with your friends, having sex, *something, anything other than what I\u2019m doing right now.* **These are the best years of your life.**\n\nBut I\u2019m home alone, and desperately lonely. I\u2019m surrounded by bloody tissues, band-aid wrappers, and a dull razor, the only evidence that remains of my attempts to replace my emotional distress with physical pain. And it\u2019s working, but not as much as I\u2019d hoped. So, I wipe the tears from my face and do something I haven\u2019t done in a whole year. I start to write.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nI was already depressed before I met him. Ever since I was little, I\u2019d heard the whispers, the pity in people\u2019s eyes. *Anxiety disorder,* I heard the doctor tell my parents, just out of sight. But just because I can\u2019t see them, it doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t hear. *Clinical depression.* *It\u2019s a shame; she\u2019s so young.* \n\nMy parents were ashamed. I\u2019d ask my mom and dad: what\u2019s wrong with me? \n\n*Nothing\u2019s wrong with you.* \n\n*You just need to stop being so sensitive.* \n\n*This is why you don\u2019t have any friends.*\n\n*Stop overreacting.*\n\n*You have nothing to be crying about.*\n\n***I\u2019ll show you something to cry about.***\n\nAnd I would cry, and cry, and cry. I wanted to throw up. I wanted to throw myself out the window. I wanted to throw myself into the ocean and erase myself from existence. \n\nBut I didn\u2019t. I don\u2019t know if it was because I was too strong to do it or too weak to do it. I guess there was always a glimmer of hope that things would get better. Somehow, I made it to college, and by that time, any hope I had left was spread pretty thin.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nI was already lonely before I met him. I had a few friends, but they were *normal*. They were having **the best years of their lives.** They were my best friends, but to be honest, I\u2019m pretty sure I wasn\u2019t anyone\u2019s best friend.\n\nMost guys weren\u2019t interested in me at all. I knew I was unattractive, but I didn\u2019t realize how bad it was until I got to college. I\u2019d try to talk to them at clubs, at parties, and at best they\u2019d nod politely and find a excuse to escape- at worst, they\u2019d make snide comments and laugh. I saw how they looked at other girls. Gorgeous, hot, pretty girls. I saw the difference between how men talked to them and how men talked to me.\n\nIt was like I didn\u2019t exist.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nI was already in therapy before I met him. Truthfully, I didn\u2019t feel like it was helping me at all. I\u2019d been going for years, tried various medications, and it seemed hopeless. I thought I would probably be depressed forever.\n\nAnd then I met him. I can\u2019t go into too much detail about him. It would be too painful. But- he was wonderful. He treated me like everyone else. He was always happy to see me. He made me feel \u2013 get this- *good* about myself. He was smart and funny. He was the person I wished I could be. He was the person I wished I could be *with.*\n\nI was used to spending most of my life in a fog of depression but when I was with him, I felt euphoric. I felt like I was flying. I never thought that I could love someone this much.\n\nBut we were just friends. And when he let me know that, in the nicest way possible of course, the illusion was shattered, and my depression came back with a roaring vengeance, as if it was angry at me for having abandoned it. \n\nI was having trouble sleeping at night, but I would sleep the whole day and miss my classes. I was nauseous and couldn\u2019t eat during the day, but I would binge eat everything in the fridge at night. \n\n*And I would cry, and cry, and cry. I wanted to throw up. I wanted to throw myself out the window. I wanted to throw myself into the ocean and erase myself from existence.* \n\nBut I\u2019m still here. I owe my life to either fear or hope, and at this point I\u2019m not sure I could call hope a positive emotion.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nIt\u2019s been months now. I still think about him. To make matters worse, I still love him. My heart jumps into my stomach whenever I see him around campus. He\u2019s nice to me, but we can\u2019t hang out anymore.\n\nThis is where I am now. Alone on a Thursday night. I don\u2019t have anyone to talk to and I don\u2019t have anyone who wants to listen. I\u2019ve checked my band-aids again to make sure they\u2019re not leaking through. I\u2019ve taken two doses of each of my meds.\n\nI\u2019m praying to God, Jesus, Allah, the Buddha, *whoever* to please make the pain go away. Please. Please don\u2019t let these be **the best years of my life.** \n\nBecause if my depression gets any worse, I don\u2019t think hope is going to be enough anymore.",

Working all day for money is something that\u2019ll never feel right to me. Work is so depressing that it makes me want to jump off a bridge and be free from it because I just don\u2019t care about work or the money I get from it. But it\u2019s not like I have an interest in meeting or talking to people so what am I to do? There\u2019s nothing for me to do here because I have nothing to chase, nothing to look forward to. I never feel \u201calive\u201d unless I fantasize about a different life but it never lasts because reality is always there to remind that I\u2019m just dreaming. I\u2019m going nowhere and everyday I have to live with the fact that I\u2019m just wasting my time aimlessly doing things I don\u2019t want to do. I\u2019m tired of living life like this but what can I do when I see nothing I want to do out there in the world? I\u2019m sick of it all and want this cycle to end already but breaking out of it seems impossible.",

            "selftext": "Turning 30 this year has been a shit show, My bf who is depressed wanted to talk about our relationship one day before I went to a bachelorette party. He\u2019s been dealing with turning 31 and not feeling adequate in life, also says he doesn\u2019t feel spark anymore. We talk it out and realize we want to stay together because there are more positives then negatives. And that maybe the loss of all joy is linked to his untreated depression (since it existed before he knew me).\n\nThen during the weekend I was away at the said party, I got roofied and sexually abused. I survived. I woke up the next morning to my bf breaking up with me via text at 8am, I call him and he\u2019s raging in such an attacking manner, saying I was a manipulative human being for trying to work out our relationship problems and that I \u201cgot in his head\u201d. He says he spoke with his roommate who says I\u2019m just someone that was supposed to be a good time. \n\nEverything burns and is coming out left wing. At this point I am sobbing asking him to just pick me up from the airport, he refused to until I beg him. Then I tell him I don\u2019t feel safe and just want to see him. He realizes something is horribly wrong and complies. My flight is delayed and I have to switch flights a day out. \n\nHe picks me up from airport, I tell him what happened to me. We get back together. I sleep with him to regain control of my body and to feel safe and connected with him. \n\nOne day goes by and I go home, he calls me 7hrs later yelling he\u2019s making a decision and that he spoke to his roommates and they think I\u2019m trying to manipulate him into staying with me, and that they don\u2019t believe the legitimacy of the events of my trauma, because trauma victims wouldn\u2019t want to be touched less than engage in sex. It\u2019s so frustrating, I am very angry and mortified. \n\nWe talk then we get back together, he says he\u2019ll try but makes no promises if he still feels no spark. He\u2019s concerned he will look weak in-front of his friends for getting back with me. I ask why, he says he\u2019s been rallying with them all day to break up with me. I tell him he\u2019s in a toxic situation and if how he\u2019s taking advice from two people who constantly break up every few months. \n\nFast forward one week, I take time off work, boss knows about my trauma and wants to be involved in it, I tell him gently no thanks, then after the one week he fires me for having a disability (from my trauma). I feel raped again, like I was betrayed. \n\nCurrently I just feel like I\u2019m drowning in it all, so much that I don\u2019t feel anything anymore. I used to cry everyday and tremble, but now the emotion runs through my mind but my body no longer \u201cemotes\u201d. I feel so empty, I wish I could cry and just melt into my bed, but nothing comes. It\u2019s like I\u2019m not even human anymore. \n\nSometimes I wonder which deity I pissed off to have this kind of garbage happen to me. \n\nI am seeing a therapist, and am trying to apply to new jobs. My bf is still with me but has been distant, I give him space though. I just don\u2019t know how to navigate and how I am alive right now, everything feels so fake. I am reading and trying to learn... and have been talking to friends but feel so empty. \n\nI hate waking up feeling suffocated and anxious. \n\nI try to fight this and know it\u2019s a concoction of many things, I am trying to remain positive but I feel like I\u2019ve been taped together really crappily.",

Hes almost out of college, but I never was able to afford it (and didn\u2019t have any support either). Finally had to remove this unsuperior figure of weight from my life. His advice to go to college has only depressed me further from the successful dream that I have, to not have to work a job at all. I really believe I can succeed so I did what I had to do to stay positive. \n\nHard but feels like so much weight has been lifted off of my shoulders for never having to compare myself to him again. His click of friends, his car, his rich parents, his college degree. I\u2019m perfectly content with my life so far with my girlfriend building my very own tiny house and I\u2019m making progress.

            "selftext": "I don't want to be able to immediately read social situations, and I don't want to convey emotion or acknowledge the emotion conveyed by others. I don't want to have serious conversations and I don't want to be quick witted. It's all too much work and it's really not worth being close to people. Being close to people is the worst. I'd rather maintain an aloof and if pushed defensive demeanor to anyone who wants to ask me if I'm okay and what's wrong. I know it's not supposed to be this uncomfortable and personally off-putting to have even the smallest bit if emotional vulnerability but whatever. Being a socially fluent person is just a skill I really despise I guess. \n\nI just don't want to have to go through all this fucking effort. I swear to god, this whole understanding social Dynamics and even having to think for a second about what I have to say or should say just pisses me off. I don't want to have to TRY to connect to people and if I'm going to feel uncomfortable doing it than fuck it and fuck life. It's not worth it and I don't WANT to be better at it. I don't want to have to deal with this bullshit. Just leave me the fuck alone when I'm in the house and if you notice me doing something like sitting in a bath for more than two hours don't bring it up as a concerned party because I am not interested in letting you in or even trying to think for a second about how I could effectively communicate anything to you.\n\nI hate emotions. I hate emotional connection and I despise other people because everything you say and how you say it is supposed to convey emotion to them. FUCK emotion. I don't want to communicate emotions. I don't want to think for a second about how what I'm going to say to you will make you feel, as long as it isn't abjectly rude. Hell, I don't care if you do think I'm being somehow rude. Yes, I will be Curt and straight to the point with you and no I'm not going to ask about you or get into any kind of discussion about literally anything because that's just more brainpower attributed to a skill that I despise and which makes me resentful if the fact that I exist at all. \n\nThe more I understand about socializing the more I hate it. It's like trying to learn math or English or music. Just leaving me empty, forced to use my brain when I would much rather tap out for 24 hours in a marijuana high. I'm not interested in accumulating information about anything or studying anything or applying what I've forced myself to learn in the real world. I just wish everyone was gone. Maybe I would go crazy, I don't know. All I know is I HATE vulnerability, and I hate people for the fact that what you say to them and the way you say it has any impact on them at all. I don't want to communicate. I don't want to share ideas or feelings, and I sure as shit am not going to share with anyone an emotional moment. I hate people in general, just for the fact that they exist and I am supposed to meaningfully interact with them. I don't want to let go of the hate. Hate is all I have. Fuck love and fuck happiness and fuck other people and fuck people for how they would react to being told that. I don't want to let you in. I'm not going to share even one significant emotional moment with anyone. I hate emotions. I hate happiness. I don't care how simple the interaction. No, I don't like smiling at you. No, I don't like listening to what you have to say. No, I don't want you to listen to me. No, I don't want to share an iota of a \"pleasant moment\" with anyone. No, I don't want to connect to anyone based on negative feelings. No, I don't enjoy interacting with or better understanding people. If I can't stand to understand plain non human subjects, why would I be enticed to understand how people work? And why the fuck would I even try to, having come all this way so fundamentally broken as to not understand them already? \n\nI don't want the way I look at you to matter. I don't want you to take into account the tone of my voice. I don't want you to understand me and I don't want to understand you. I don't want to feed off  anyone's emotions or my interactions with them. I just want to be fucking done with it all. I don't care if social anxiety has anything to do with it. Fuck everybody. I'm not willing to go through another year or more of battling it and I have only made marginal progress in my social skills anyways so fuck it all, fuck practicing, fuck studying, just give me a fucking gun already. In not willing to put in this much work in ANY sense. Fuck doing this shit to try to get better everyday and honestly fuck trying to actually UNDERSTAND socializing. I'm not willing to look back and see what went right and what went wrong and all that and I can't do that shit anyways because I'm either too stupid or too anxious or both but either way I'm far from interested in trying to remedy either situation. \n\nI just fucking hate this shit and I'm tired if trying to come around and actually love people. I'm too used to just hating everyone, I can't humble myself to remedy the problem. Guess I'm just to broken to admit my faults. I only feel secure around people by feeling like I'm better than them, that there is a reason for me to feel like I am better. I can only find things about people that I hate, but never what I love, because I don't really love anything about people, and to try to logically convince myself why I should value them or what I should like about them is simply too far a change from who I have become fundamentally. I would choose to be a loser and stay the same. It doesn't matter because I'm going to die and I fucking refuse to give this life any weight.",

I'm a guy who I've always tried to see the best in people but I'm actually just too nice and easy to take advantage of cause anyone who shows me any kinda interest I end up trusting too easy. Why? Cause I'm lonely and depressed. Well recently things got way worse cause I thought I had met the girl of my dreams. She was perfect in almost every way. She was beautiful, smart, funny and even nerdy. It was amazing. We clicked from the beginning and we talked everyday and night for weeks. Would spend hours on the facetime or etc just talking away. She saw my bad days and my good days and never judged me for them. She told me all the right things and made me feel wanted for who I was. She took away the boring day to day and gave me something to look forward to. She gave me hope and made me feel so in love. And she told me she loved me. And i said i loved her too. Keep in mind she said it first, this is important. Well I felt pulled by this feeling to go and see her. I drove 10 hours to see her. 10 hours. And when I did see her it all felt so right. The kisses, the hugs, the holding hands, her head on my chest. It felt so right. Well my dream came to a end. She didnt love me. She loved the things I did that her fiancee didnt do. Oh yes. She was engaged turns out. I loved her. She didnt love me. Now I'm back home and I feel so hurt, so empty. Everything that felt so right now just tortures my thoughts. I can't stop thinking about her. I'm drinking more than ever. I just want to forget and move on. I dont want to feel this way. I just never felt love like that before and then to have it snatched away and then hear she never even loved me at all. It hurts.",

My lifeline is laughter, but I'm so fucking done with going back to the greats, those I can admire as clever but never feel the soul of, and discovering that though I appreciate their art, I can't bring myself to laugh. My favorite comedians in the world are starting to lose my attention and feeling. It's such a painful goodbye, too, because I know once this is over I'll have nothing. Nothing but the void, nothing to confront the void with like before. Comedy brought a light to the void, horror let me embrace it in a strange sense of calm, and emotional music was inspiring to me. I just don't feel any of it anymore. My fire is fading. And one of the worst parts is that I'm gonna lie to myself again. I'm gonna light the fire with a spark of mania and it'll burn down to shit again. Watching it burn and burn over and over until it's reduced to ashes is torture beyond imagination. Whatever.",

I can't seem to stop stuttering and I have long awkward pauses where I can't think of anything to say or do. Fk. This is why I barely have friends that hang out with me. My only friend that I do hang out with is going to be occupied with a job in the near future. I'm gon kill myself one of these days. On top of all that,  I had postpone all 5 of my class projects.

I am not sure if a self diagnosis like this is valid but most of the symptoms matches up.\n\n My has been on anti depressants for 10 years so I think it's genetic. I didn't think it affected me at all until a couple of months ago, I thought it was just laziness before.\n\n I'm 19 years old, im not suicidal and I don't take drugs, but this is really affecting me personally, physically and my school work is suffering heavily.

            "selftext": "I'm 26 and female. I still live at home because I don't make enough money to move out, but it's okay because I have a great relationship with my parents. I worry about life after they are gone one day. I know I will be alone. I don't have any friends. Since a devastating heartbreak over a year ago, I am not able to have another romantic relationship, and I feel like I can't ever again. I can't trust anyone.\n\nI'm terrified to live a life alone. I have a Bachelor's degree and some good experience, but I'm stuck in a poor city (USA) with low paying dead end jobs. I won't have enough money to live alone.  I would love to move, but again I don't have the money, unless I would get a job somewhere else first. But my current city has no opportunities and my only experience is secretary work. No one really hire secretaries from another state.\n\nIt's been so long like this that I feel completely hopeless and unmotivated. I've thought about pursuing work online through videos/blogs about things I enjoy and being a \"personality\" but that's all about luck - which I have none of. I'm not seeking millions of dollars, but just enough to keep myself, and to be able to do something I enjoy.\n\nI try to work on my creative projects, but sometimes weeks go by and I don't. I end up coming home after an extremely long day at work, and crash in my bed watching videos online.\n\nI went to 2 therapy sessions before I had to quit because I just can't afford it. I found it was going to be very helpful for me, but of course, lack of money yet again wins.\n\nI'm scared I'll end up homeless one day. My parents are broke and anything they are left by their parents will all be spent. I will get no inheritance of any kind, so I can't even consider that one day. I am completely and utterly on my own. It scares me so bad that I'll be stuck in this poor city forever and struggling to keep a roof over my head with dead end jobs. I don't know what to do or how to prepare when I have nothing to prepare with (like saving money). I have thought about leaving the USA for a small, secluded European place, but that takes a lot of money too. And if I live until I'm in my 90's.. that's even worse because that's a hell of a long time to be alone.",

            "selftext": "Hello, I need some advice, im not a redditter, I've simply decided to write this in order to get some help. I've visited 3 therapists in my life, none have helped me overcome this. I'm 20 years old male, In excellent physical shape and a passion in the artistic field. I guess I could say I didn't have the best passage to adult hood (past traumatic experiences). Currently im experiencing constant thoughts of death/suicide, insane paranoia (eg. I'm anxious about looking at my phone camera, always looking behind me in public places, always thinking people are out to get me, etc.). I have alot of anger issues, l zone out about 70% of the time and enter a state of negative thoughts. I'm always super depressed and hate everything around me. Im very socially anxious, i cant even engage a conversation without feeling insecure. When it comes to female interactions I can't even find any of them attractive because my brain immediately assumes they're unfaithful and only live for their own sexual pleasures (past experiences have alot to do with that but not just that). Seeing people happy makes me hate and seeing them sad makes me joyful. I tried smoking weed and all it did is heighten those emotions. I genuinely don't know what to do anymore, I want to be able to live a life of happiness, but im constantly bombarded with these thoughts, I tend to lie alot to project a happy image of me to mask the sadness. Also my circle isn't very \"good\" so to speak, my friends don't even acknowledge my existence and always treat women like shit, they are heavy gamblers and will go to extremities to get money, they use me alot as a \"bodyguard\" due to my size and always assuming my sexuality due to my lack in female interest, yet I cant seem to break our friendship, I hate their actions but I don't want to fall into even more loneliness. I even break down in tears for no apparent reason. Thank you for taking the time to read through this, I hope to receive advice in order to finally better myself.",

People ask me \"where does all your money go\", I tell them I don't know. They ask why I'm so tired, worn down, unhappy, I tell them I don't know, just not sleeping enough. They give me encouragement and tools for success and positive vibes. I don't use them, I don't even consider them. I tell them I don't know but I do. \n\nIt's drugs. It's always been drugs and it will always be drugs. Weed when I was younger, coffee and high doses of caffeine throughout, alcohol always, heroin for a short time, cocaine and whisky to get me through years of restaurant work, I binge on food and frivolous spending. Lately it's been nitrous oxide. At $30 a case I've spent a small fortune this year alone. The drugs, especially this one, take me to a different place. One that may or may not exist, depending on the substance, and I can't get enough. I don't like it here. I don't want to be here. I wake up and dream about getting off work in the evening and blasting off to a place where everything is different. I am not me. For the time the nitrous lasts I am happy in some other reality I couldn't begin to explain. Over and over again I race back to that place of supreme obscurity. When it's all over I crash back into this reality and think about tomorrow night when I get to go there again. I'm sure there's a story out there that has been written about a young boy who gets lost in a fantasy land. Who loses grip with reality and can not bear the thought of leaving his Fantasia. In that story I bet it gets resolved at the end and he finds a compromise but in mine he grows old and frail and as the years pass he becomes more and more wilfully entrapped by his fantasy world. In mine, I'm afraid to say, he never stops chasing that imaginary world and in the end it kills him. He dies without his friends and family ever really knowing him, above his grave they cry, adjacent to them is another group, figures and contorted forms through which the rain passes unphased. Imaginary being who only ever existing in this boys mind, and in his grave it is those undying apparitions for whom he mourns. \n\nI've come clean to my family and they are taking precautions to help me stay away from the gas but all I can think and wonder is what will the next drug be. There is no doubt in my mind I will find it and hold on until it kills me. Good night.",

I am now on day 3 of going unintentionally cold-turkey and I'm probably (not) dying.\n\nI have been coping, dealing, and honestly excelling at life more than I have in...a decade? I have worked impossibly hard to get where I am. Now, this happens.\n\nI am so frustrated. My mind and body are pissed. I'm sweating uncontrollably, throwing up, not eating, anxiety attacks galore, bouts of uncontrollable crying, my OCD is becoming noticeable to my coworkers, which I am so embarrassed about. My head is not in the game.\n\nI work with special needs kindergarteners and I couldn't finish my work day and I've already called out tomorrow. I feel like I'd be a liability if I tried to keep small children alive tomorrow. I wouldn't be effective.\n\nAll of these withdrawal symptoms are completely out of my control, and control is something I need in my life. I have been doing every single thing right to keep my mental health under control and I'm so fucking pissed that it's so easy to feel like all of those successes have just been thrown away for the time being.\n\nThis was purely a rant. It also happens to be my first post in this sub. My pharmacy is hoping to get a shipmemt tomorrow, but they were not willing to promise anything, which is fair. So I do have hope that this will turn around, but for right now I am having a hardcore pity party.\n\nI hope none of you are going throw something similar because this is the pits! This post may have been all over the place, but it perfectly mirrors my brain at the momemt.\n\nStay safe and make safe choices, friends! I am available for talking and venting if any of you want to reach out with questions or whathave you!",

I had lots of friends and was happy but then I started getting anxiety and started to Isolate myself by hiding behind games and would just get lost in them, throughout the years I've gotten worse and gone completely numb. I don't ask for help because I don't want to be a burden to anyone not even myself.\n\nI dropped out of school a few times because I had no energy or motivation and couldn't get any sleep due to insomnia, over spring break. I manage to get my hands on Marijuana for my sleep, it was so blissful and never felt better then one day I had a intense breakdown about how my life would be if I let depression devour my soul, so I decide to self-improve since myself over the summer after I had lots of time to learn and expand my mind about the stuff I've been going through. I started working out, getting out of the house more, traveling and hiking while stoned on weed I felt amazing and decided to go back to school. As school was starting I noticed that I could concentrate a little more but as days went on I started backsliding and now I am back were I started Empty, lonely and lost with severe anxiety. I just want relief from this stress and depression. Life is tough and I am not ready to end it since I was happy for a little while and believe that I can be like that again one day.",

At first, I was somewhat dejected by this, but the new doctor's office I just signed up with is said to be really good with mental health support and even has a facility that focuses solely on mental health and recovery. I actually can't wait for the appointment now. It's been way too long that I've been struggling through hellish bouts of depression that the thought of finally getting help makes me feel like there's a chance to get through life.",

            "selftext": "Hi this is a throwaway account. Im basically just gonna give a rundown of my life. 7th grade I walk into school and everyone is just different towards me. I did not hang out with kids from my school during summer because I went to a beach club and hung out with the kids there during the summer. I walk in and everyone is just different and like exclusive and it seemed like no one was really a little kid anymore. I had no friends the whole year and just started playing computer games to cope with the pain. 8th grade same deal cool kids were dicks to me whatever all good i was used to this already. 8th grade summer I made what I thought was a really good group off girls and guys. I hung out with them everyday and they really seemed to like me. Then highschool starts and they all just stop talking to me. They all went to a public highschool and I went to a private one. They stopped inviting me to stuff, talking to me, like it fucking sucked. So again lost all my friends and was lonley and depressed again for the entire freshman year of highschool. Freshman year summer roles around and I met three kids. Two of them I am still super close with but one of them stopped talking to us after we got arrested for having weed on us at a fair. Anyway getting arrested and loosing another friend sends me into a deeper depression sophmore year. I had friends now though which made things alot better. Junior year rolls around and I am still depressed and fucking sad. School gets stressful with SATS and a bitchy religous teacher causes me alot of stress. My hair starts falling out and i'm diagnosed with  Alopecia. Basically when Im under anxiety or stress my hair falls out. This makes me even more fucking sad then I already was. Junior year prom rolls around and me and my prom date start dating. I was actually happy for like 2 months until shit started hitting the fan. She was a pathological liar but I have to admit she did make me happy for junior year summer.  Well senior year rolls around and I break up with a girl that I thought I love. Man did this fuck me up in the head. During the entire senior year I was so fucking depressed and sad. Like I don't even know why. It made no sense to me like nothing did anymore. (By the way during this time I was heavily into computer gaming. I would smoke weed with my friends every friday and Saturday and on the week days just get home and play on my computer. Most of highschool i was addicted to a video games. ) I was at a basketball game with my dad and like I was just thinking why I couldnt be happy. I was in New York City watching a college basketball game with my loving father and I was just sad. For some reason I will never forget this day I was so sad it was so awful. Senior year summer rolls up and I am pretty depressed still like nothing really changed. I came to college a month ago. At my school I wanted to join a fraternity. So there is a rush process where you go to frat's events and see which ones you like. I got invited to the last invite only events of the fraternity that I wanted to join so badly. I was happy for the first time in like   6 years being at college with a new begging. It was fucking great like I havent felt that happy in so long. I was told by the leaders of the frat that I was fine and was most likely getting a bid (an invite to the frat). I actually liked these guys and made friends with alot of them. They seemed like they liked having me around. Then invite day comes and guess what..... No invite to the frat lol. That was like two weeks ago and man let me tell you. I am so fucking depressed right now you guys have no idea. All the friends I made here are out doing stuff with their frat so I just sit in my dorm and watch netflix. Like goddamn. Im so bored like I dont want to join any clubs here I just want to be happy. I tell my parents and they are just like join some clubs. I go surfing with these two kids and like it is fun but fuck man I am still just sad. Someone please just talk to me or something I have been fucking sad for six years. I feel like I always fuck up and loose my friends. I think its because Im just an asshole or something.",

I feel like someone sucked out my emotions and now my consciousness is just left. During these periods I usually spend my time smoking weed or drinking just to feel something. I remember I was going through this once and my father came very close to dying and I didn\u2019t care I wasn\u2019t even phased. I also don\u2019t have wants or worries when I\u2019m like this. I have to force myself to eat because I don\u2019t really care about food. I don\u2019t look forward to anything. I just have to wait for it to go away to feel normal again. Does anyone else experience depression this way? Is there a way to make it go away? Would meds help?",

I have no reason to be depressed, so I\u2019m not really sure if I am or not? I wish there was some blood test to just tell you if you are or not. Some days I\u2019m perfectly fine, and then the next day I can feel completely empty. It\u2019s very hard for me to explain. I just feel like I will be crying for no reason. I will feel like I\u2019m so alone it hurts, even though I have my parents who love me. I really wish I could explain how I feel. I saw someone I knew committed suicide and instead of feeling sad, I felt jealous? Which is weird. I guess I was jealous that he was able to do it. Which again, sounds weird. I don\u2019t know why I thought that but I felt really bad about it. Just when I get feeling like this I feel like death is freedom, you won\u2019t feel any of this then. I\u2019ve been so tired lately. All I do is sleep, and I\u2019m not even hungry (which is odd for me). I can go all day without eating because I just feel nothing sometimes. I really wish I could explain this better but I can\u2019t. I just don\u2019t know if maybe I\u2019m being dramatic, like I feel alone because I am not with people that second, or I\u2019m crying because I\u2019m just a baby, or I\u2019m sleeping because I\u2019m lazy, things like that. Plus if it\u2019s depression, would it be random? Like one day fine the next suddenly I feel like I am a robot? Sometimes I can even be fine half the day and one thing will happen and put me in that funk... so that\u2019s why I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s actually depression or if I\u2019m dramatic.

            "selftext": "A couple years ago I went through middle school, and spent pretty much all my time in my room playing video games, watching YouTube, etc, and would rarely do anything. Although I\u2019m pretty smart and used to be amazing at school, my grades were dropping because I was to lazy and unmotivated to do any of the work. I was just a lazy fat bastard to my extremely demanding parents. (Note: my parents aren\u2019t abusive emotionally or physically they just have high standards for me) I was a disappointment to them and was getting bullied. I had a few friends but was too antisocial to go out and do stuff with them. Come 8th grade I decide that I don\u2019t want to feel guilty and sad and stuff so I try to change my life. I started to work out a little, study harder (although it was difficult), and even try to be more social (which I think came across as overly energetic and annoying more than anything) I rarely had suicidal thoughts that year. Then I entered high school. The high school I go to is way better then my middle school and probably most high schools in general. I\u2019m in fairly good shape compared to a couple years ago, have all As in a bunch of honors classes, and have a fairly nice social. My parents are proud of me. Yet, for some reason, I\u2019m just so sad and empty inside. The only motivation I have at all is the fear of disappointing my friends and family again. If I didn\u2019t have that I would just give up. Even with that it\u2019s a fight everyday to do anything. Despite so much positive stuff in my life I have trouble to find any happiness and I switch from feeling sad to empty. I just want to quit everything I worked so hard for. I feel like these expectations are chains wrapped around my throat and suffocating me. I can\u2019t do it anymore. I don\u2019t get it I did everything right, I should be happy. The only reasons I haven\u2019t killed myself is my faith in God. Without that I\u2019d probably be to much of a pussy to do it anyways. Still, I wish I was diagnosed with cancer or hit by a bus or something, at least then people wouldn\u2019t feel as if it\u2019s their fault or be mad at me or think of me as the coward i am, but instead pity me and be able to move on when I\u2019m gone.",

I opened it and found my bro's old weapon. I immediately recognized it because he had it customized and hand craved his fav symbol on it...I started crying remembering this weapon. I grew up and poor in a broken home and bad neighborhood (still live there) and my bro had to drop out &amp; work really hard just to keep food on the table. He got involved in the wrong crowd and I still remember him carrying this weapon everywhere he went. I hate this weapon in one way because Idk what he was doing but I'm sure it wasn't legal he ended up in the hospital or would come home with terrible injuries quite often...he turned into a different person.. but at the same time when he started carrying this we never worried about food again I finally had much needed clothes and shoes so kids stopped Making fun of me for not smelling good(at times our water was cut off) or dressing like a bum and life was almost ok for us (until his death) we would even go on great family vacations have actual birthday parties and Christmas and stuff (which we never did prior)...I seriously am at a crossroads here and I'm just so sad and angry this weapon helped my life be a bit normal but on the other hand it took my brother from me it makes me wonder how many times this weapon has been used...but it's my brother's keepsake....I don't have anything to remember him by....LITERALLY NOTHING....what do I do ???",

I'm actually going to sleep at a decent time tonight, because I don't want to experience the rest of my night if I can't get high. I don't care to fill my spare time with things that are \"fun.\" I don't want to learn any new skills or practice anything. This is why I never understood why people like math. I hate problem solving, I hate figuring things out. At this point I just want to drift along until someone or something kills me. It's only a matter of time. This fucking life is bullshit. I curse whatever god there may be for allowing me to experience this finite, mortal existence. \n\nI curse responsibility. I curse accountability. I curse everyday tasks. I curse the day ahead of me tomorrow, and the next day, and the next day. I curse everything about life. I curse happiness and I curse fulfilment. I don't want to have to exist in the first place, because that I exist means I'm also going to die and never exist again.\n\nI mean shit, I'd appreciate life, if I didn't have to give a shit about my own health and survival. I'd appreciate life if I didn't have to be subjected to social ties necessary for survival. I'd appreciate life more if I was the only person on the planet, and I didn't have to give a shit about things.  I'd appreciate it if I could just get high and tune out 24/7. I stead I'm left dealing with this shit hole of an existence, dealing with everything that comes with it. \n\nWell I don't want to deal with what comes with it. I don't want to experience most of what life has to offer. I just don't give a single shit about anything, and I'm not able to. I don't give a single fuck about having core values. I don't give a single fuck about having a personal philosophy or code. A man DOESN'T got to have a code. I'm not capable of accepting mental stimulation like others. I can't dive deep into any kind of hobby or subject because I just don't give a single shit. It's not my fault I don't either. I didn't choose to be this way and I'm sure as shit not going to choose to try not to be.\n\nI just don't feel enlightened or intrigued by anything like other people are. My buddy the other day was all jovial about how China's dictator looks like Winnie the Pooh, but I could not give a fuck, even if I could understand the humor. Same thing when anyone tried to tell me about literally anything that's supposed to elicit an emotional response of some kind. It's not that I don't understand what you're saying, I just. Don't. Give. A . Shit. And I don't really have a say in that. Want fucking proof? I force myself through these conversations every day, forcing out pretend interest, same thing with just going off to learn about shit on my own, but it just don't matter. Forcing myself to care doesn't mean I actually do, and there is no fucking reasoning behind why I don't care. I will not logic myself out of this \"rut\" or rather this \"life,\" because thoughts and notions hold no weight in my mind. I'm not willing to constant remind myself if whatever logic there fucking is to be interested in something either. That's why life is shit. If I can't just build UP, if I have to constantly deal with going DOWN, well, I don't want any part of it, and frankly, thinking about it just gets me so goddamn existentially angry that I fantasize about going on a murderous rampage as the only means to relieve the fucking dilemma, so yes, I am just going to keep getting high, and when I can't get high I'll just completely tune out of this pointless experience instead of trying to fill the boredom with something else, because nothing else will ever compare to the high. Nothing. Absolutely nothing else is worth living for, and you can blame your pathetic God for introducing a world in which heaven already exists if you just seek it out and ignore everything and everyone else.",

She\u2019s an excellent worker that likes to get things done, and expects the same of you. I\u2019ve been working with her a lot for the past few weeks and she has a very sadistic personality and likes to hurt your feelings. She\u2019s fat shamed me multiple times by calling me \u201cpepperoni nipples\u201d, or saying things like \u201chave you ever thought of working out\u201d. It\u2019s been extremely frustrating. This one night I was working with her and another worker. The other worker is a girl  too and they were just laughing at me. I argued back at the them, but what chance do I stand? It\u2019s only one of me and two of them. I left home that night extremely butthurt and helpless. Since that day I was doing fairly well, but then tonight happened... we had finished all of our work and the girl and I had fun conversations, but once we had nothing to do we went up to the other worker that was there. It\u2019s the same one that joined her side to make fun of me. That\u2019s when the girl started making fun of me again. Then she started throwing stuff at me as if I\u2019m an animal she\u2019s trying to shoo away. Out of anger I grabbed a penny she threw at me and threw it right at her. Then we started arguing more intensely and we said how much we hated each other. The other girl that likes to team up with her was just laughing. It\u2019s angering me too much. It\u2019s turning to a habit of them harassing me, especially that one girl. I need to stop this someway. I work with the girl in a few days, and I\u2019m going to see how she treats me. If it ends up being the same bull crap then i might consider reporting her to management. Tell me what you guys think I should do in this tough situation.",

It's not particularly that I've given up, just that I stopped.  I start and start and start but never finish.  \n\n\nAn example of something I've not abandoned is the Minecraft server I started, which has been rewarding and people actually want to play on it.  But everything else... There was so much I wanted to get done.\n\n\nHere are a few.  I wanted to finish writing my Self Authoring program. I wanted to read through and do all the exercises in my programming book I bought (I got 14 pages in).  Same for the other textbook I bought.  I even calculated how many pages is have to read/work through to get done by September.  I wanted to restart my daily meditation, and work out more.  Of course you can guess what happened there.  \n\n\nI am lucky enough to receive 5 free counseling sessions from a psychologist at my university, and I use them.  She says I could benefit from medication, but it would cost several hundred dollars just for the evaluations.  I think I'm bipolar, I never told her that.  Our last meeting ended on a bad note, and I don't think I'll ever see her again.  I feel really bad about that.\n\n\nIn terms of professional development, how am I supposed to find work if, say, an application process takes a few weeks?  I was applying to something I was super excited for, but I've ... I've not lost interest, that's the weird thing, but... I stopped making progress towards it.  Same as everything else.\n\n\nI'm probably going to become homeless soon if I can sort myself.  Graduating soon.  I'm absolutely terrified. I don't think I've been more scared of the future than I am now. I don't know how anyone does it.  I know I am just *barely* qualified to enter the workforce in my field.  How other graduates go straight from school to work blows my fucking mind.  Fuck man, how.  How the hell are you that fucking lucky, or that good at advertising yourself.  \n\n\nI've managed to stave off serious depression these last 2 years, but if I graduate and can't find work... I mean wtf is the point.  I want to keep on living, but being useless, unappreciated, hated even... That's what unemployed people are.  That's when I will kill myself.",

I've thought about reaching out to new people but everytime I think they might just think 'oh god what does he want.'\n\nI want to talk to someone about so that's why I came here. But this isnt enough. I need to let my parents or a consueler or somebody know. The only problem is that.\n\n1. My mom gets really stressed out and emotional when one of us is either sick or not well. \n\n2. I have a feeling I might be hospitalized if I try to go to a consueler or doctor.\n\nI need help getting back on track with my motivation and getting my suicidal thoughts out of my head.\n\nI always feel like a nuisance no matter what I do or how I do it. I always feel like I'm in the way.\n\nAny responses are greatly appreciated. I'm 16 and a sophomore of anybody needed that.\n\nPlease let me know if this is the wrong sub I'm sorry if it is.",

            "selftext": "I apologize this post might be a little long. I\u2019ve never posted anything on reddit before but I feel like I need to get it off my chest and maybe get some advice on what to do. \n\nI\u2019ve (F18) gone through some trauma over the past year. I have struggled with depression and anxiety for five-six years, and I\u2019ve also always had a rocky relationship with both my mom and dad. A little over a year ago, I was violently raped and my rapist then moved into my house with my parents and I. A little backstory, after the whole incident, I tried to deny what happened to me and I didn\u2019t tell anyone as I suppressed a lot of my memory &amp; thoughts about it. Long story short, a month after, my rapist (M19) was getting kicked out of his house. My mom offered him to live in our house.  As soon as I was told that he\u2019d live with us, it\u2019s like everything hit me like a truck. My depression and anxiety was the worst it has ever been, and I developed PTSD. \n\nLiving in the same house as someone who caused me so much trauma and pain was tortue for me, he often tried making advances on me and ultimately completely turned my mom and dad against me. I even sometimes feared for my life. I tried committing suicide but I just ended up super sick. The day after I went to the doctors and got a prescription for some medication, and started going to therapy.  \n\nMy therapist and I, after several months finally worked up enough courage for myself to ask my parents to make him leave. At this point I still didn\u2019t tell them what happened to me, even though they obviously knew my mental health was terrible, they knew I hated the guy, and they knew something was wrong (they just never helped or wanted to). A few weeks later my rapist moved out, and I told my parents what happened to me. \n\nFrom this situation that happened to me and my steep decline in mental health, I was unable to complete/graduate from my last year of high school and I dropped out. I also stopped doing extra curricular activities and leaving my house.  \n\nIt has been 3/4 of a year since he moved out, and I have been getting better mentally and emotionally but I still have severe depression, anxiety, and ptsd. I worked really hard on my triggers and I don\u2019t have as many &amp; they don\u2019t bother me as much as before. I also started to finish up some classes at home or at night school. I\u2019m really proud of myself and I have come really far. \n\nI also have a boyfriend, and we have been dating for 10 months, just before I got my rapist out of my house. So my boyfriend knows what has happened to me, although he is not one to really be emotionally open or anything related. He does care about my feelings but is no where near comprehending to how much things (like my triggers, depression, anxiety, etc) affect me. He is the type of guy to say \u201cJust don\u2019t be sad\u201d. \n\nI often come to crossroads with myself and him and whether I should leave him out of my emotions and feelings, and whether I should open up more. When I try to open up more it seems like he is uninterested. I know it is hard for him to understand things and when I do try to explain, it\u2019s hard for me to get the right words out.  \n\nI\u2019ve been leaving him out and isolating myself when I\u2019m sad and depressed and I normally don\u2019t even tell him when I\u2019m sad either. I feel like a burden to him when I get emotional but I know I have to communicate more about it. \n\nA few times my boyfriend and I have seen my rapist out in public, and I try my hardest not to have a panic attack and completely shut down. I have gotten extremely upset around him and he gets very uncomfortable and doesn\u2019t know what to do. Once again the \u201cJust don\u2019t be sad, think of something else.\u201d.  \n\nI guess I just need advice as to how do I tell or show my boyfriend how I feel. How can I help him understand my mental health, or just depression and anxiety in general? There are other factors to my depression but the biggest thing affecting me is my trauma (as it had a big negative ripple effect in every other area of my life). Is there a way I can tell him things without him getting awkward and closing up? I don\u2019t want to isolate myself because it strains our relationship (on my side at least). \n\nHas anyone experienced something similar to what I\u2019m going through and have any tips? \n\nThank you, and I appreciate anyone\u2019s time who reads / answers this post!",

            "selftext": "**Depression is** being alive in the eyes of everyone else but dead to who you used to be. \n\n**Depression is** wanting better for yourself, but not being able to pick yourself up out of the slump. \n\n**Depression is** pretending. Pretending that everything is okay. When if you told the truth, no one would understand. \n\n**Depression is** the desire to do nothing. \n\n**Depression is** watching your life pass you by, while you live in a glass box on the sideline. \n\n**Depression is** being numb to everything. \n\n**Depression is** those close to you saying \u201cIt will get better\u201d. Not knowing you tell yourself that but it doesn\u2019t change. \n\n**Depression is** that relationship you gave your all to, for years just to come away with nothing. While someone else reaps the benefits of what you tried to sow. \n\n**Depression is** regret. \n\n**Depression is** the inability to care, like you used to for things you once did.\n\n**Depression is** wanting to \u201cJust be happy\u201d, while fighting just to stay alive. \n\n**Depression is** a onslaught of emotions that hit like bricks whenever they feel like it. \n\n**Depression is** \u201chaving hope\u201d only because someone else gave it you.\n\n**Depression is** fleeting motivation. \n\n**Depression is** ugly. Its unfair.\n\nAll of these things an more, Depression is. But one thing I can say about it. **Depression, is not, your fault.** \n\n\\-Hax\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, i sat down just write this out about 15 mins ago. Not my usual style of writing by far. I always write in rhythm and rhyme but this time, this subject, I didn't matter. I just needed to write what I've been feeling.

I've struggled with depression and body dysmorphia for a very very long time. I just want to look and be pretty like people I see on Instagram. I want to be skinny and get plastic surgery. I have no friends in college and all of my internet friends live far away. They know about my problems, but I just know deep deep down inside that they're tired of me and wouldn't care if I'm gone. I can't get a job since no one would hire me and I've been trying for years. I'm just a burden in everyone's lives. I think I really want to end it all this weekend and jump in front of a moving train. I really do.",

            "selftext": "I\u2019m a 16 year old living in a dysfunctional household. My dad is an alcoholic, being nice and tranquil in the morning time and by the time he gets home he is constantly angry and emotionless. My mom is happy at all times unless my dad is around. She gets extremely stressed out and she cries and always apologizes when it is all over. My sister is a spoiled brat that just ignores all the terrors of our family and focuses solely on tormenting me. \n\nAnd I am a psycho. Fighting has always been extremely scary to me, as I have seen my parents try to hurt each other during fights. During the fights I freak out, I start screaming my head off and I can\u2019t stop. I slap the walls until my hands hurt and I always end up splayed out on the floor and shaking. \n\nGrowing up I have always hated school with a passion, but I\u2019m starting to realize that school is the only place I can really feel happy without the stress of being at home. On the other hand, I never want to be at school because I am in constant fear that I will come home to one of my parents dead, by being killed by the other or by suicide. I know it sounds crazy but this is how I really feel.\n\nThe only reason my parents are still together is because of me. I don\u2019t think that I could ever make it through their divorce, and even though they threaten each other with it constantly, I don\u2019t think they would ever actually split up for my sake.\n\nAm I doing something wrong? I have seen people online saying to just stay out of the fights and let them take their course until they are resolved but I feel like these will never be resolved. \n\nIs this what a normal family is like? You don\u2019t hear much about this kind of thing but people don\u2019t seem to talk about their family life much anyways. Is this \u201cjust another family\u201d or is this unusual? Are there others hiding their constant pain on the inside?",

I can't self-diagnose myself with depression, as I feel self-diagnosis is unfair to those who are truly diagnosed, but I felt very terrible yesterday and nothing was good.\n\nI have a different religious feeling from my father, and I strongly believe in something else and it angers me when I see people believe in something that felt cult-like to me. My father can't know because he would be mad.\n\nMy mother, who lives in a different state from me, was roofied and threatened, almost sexually assaulted but she has incredible instincts, and I was not there to help her. She is fine now and is helping other young women speak up about the same person, but I can't get out of my head that I should have been there for her.\n\nMy grades are truly poor and I feel like they are all collapsing on me. Some of my teachers are ruthless and I keep finding myself getting lost and behind. \n\nI have liked one girl for a long time and I know she only thinks of me as a friend. I am completely okay with this but I can't find a good way to move on and act like I don't like her.\n\nI have had a passion for film for 5 years until now and it is fading away. I am branded as the guy who wants to go to film school to my family and changing that to them I feel like I would anger them.\n\nI am struggling with a popular addiction, I don't feel comfortable typing it out but it recently has been a cause to prevent it. I also can't sleep without using a certain other substance that can make you drowsy and hungry.\n\nI had a panic attack yesterday and I can't see it not happening again. I have had one other in my life about two months ago. All of the stress I feel like I am under makes me really unhappy.\n\nMy friends try and tell me it will get better but I struggle to find anything that would make it better. There is something missing in me and I am struggling to find out what it is.\n\nSome of my friends have become continually insensitive about certain matters that don't necessarily concern me but are topics that just are not funny to joke about. I don't judge political views but I  judge close-minded and insensitive views.\n\nI just don't feel like I have anything going for me right now.

Listening to music, reliving the day and the jokes with my best friend, being so relived that I have no homework and I\u2019m actually keeping up... then I\u2019ll start crying. Idk if they\u2019re tears of relief or what. Those thoughts I think of every night float in. I can\u2019t figure out how I actually feel. Whether or not I\u2019m actually happy. I think a lot about how I\u2019m feeling and questioning everything as well. Like am I okay? \n\nI feel like myself, yet I have depression hanging over my head. An anxiety and OCD ridden mind. Why am I able to be happy, laugh, be so optimistic and yet I\u2019ll beat myself up, have deprecating thoughts, randomly cry without reason, constantly worry, worry about people touching me all day while going to the bathroom to wash my hands... go back and fourth all day.... so contradictory yet I feel comfortable with in. Is this a good thing ??? Why do I feel comfortable ??? Why ??? Am I happy ??? What do I feel, who am I... I can\u2019t answer that. Like I don\u2019t know.",

            "selftext": "I felt I needed to share my feelings here, because I don't know if my mom would understand and because I can't see my therapist right now. \n\nRecently I have been diagnosed with, along with my current conditions, bipolar disorder and ADHD. I haven't even realized that I have been suffering from these problems until my medication provider and I talked. I was told that I had many red flags for bipolar and was prescribed to a mood stabilizer the same day. I had felt my anxiety rise, my leg started  bouncing after my anxiety triggered. It only became slightly worse that a few days later that my therapist looked through what I had been diagnosed with, I don't exactly remember what for but it was we were talking about my conditions, and saw my medication provider had diagnosed me with Adhd. I had called it. A year ago I had read the signs and realized that I might have it, now it was confirmed. Now I know why each of everyday I was suffering from insides outwards. I hated myself for so long because I had no idea. I used to think I was a horrible kid with a bad attitude that just couldn't change. \n\nNow it was all different. I don't hate myself much anymore. I still think about death sometimes and try to find less painful ways to harm myself, only to realize I should stop. I have come to accept that I am not completely mentally stable, but I could get better. I have been writing my thoughts down and have been trying to focus on schooling but I have been still dealing with a bit of hesitancy with doing it. School was always dreadful. I hated school, because it was a religious school. I will say I believe in God and don't doubt him. But I feel so ashamed going into his church. I feel so wrong inside. School made it worse with failing grades or just Ds and Cs on my report cards until 7th &amp; 8th grade. When my manic episode hit and lasted for a long time, meaning completely throughout the entire two years. From feeling so good at school, to being utterly depressed at home after doing my homework. It was always a emotional dice roll through my time in elementary. I hated everyone and wanted to be alone, but I also craved attention and hated being completely alone by myself.\n\nI suffered and still do. I still want to hurt myself and think about death sometimes. I tend to hate everyone and everything for short burts and then feel guilty afterwards. I don't understand how someone can handle so many problems and go on with life. I crave to write so badly and want to learn, but even now I just feel so tired, mentally, physically, and emotionally. I don't even care about other people sometimes, even when they are taken by death. I just feel like I can't bring myself to care anymore sometimes. Does that make me a bad person? I don't really know...\n\nI hope that whoever decides to read this that you can give me advice on what to do, and how to help my conditions. I also hope you don't feel alone in the world.",

One day I feel okay, like everything is in place, and on the other I just feel like nothing matters and my life is a mess, and that I'm just worthless and no one would miss if I was gone.\n \nNormally I can mask these mood swings very well, but for about a year or so I have been failing a lot in keeping together enough to put this \"mask\" at times.\n \nAnother problem that I have, is that I can't see myself existing in a distant future (or even at a not so distant future), and that doesn't seem too scary, which makes me feel somewhat concerned.\n \nI don't understand why I keep this line of thought and have these kind of feelings and behaviour. I feel that I need professional help, but at the same time I'm not being strong enough to force myself to go after it. I just kind accept this situation and let this continue.\n \nI'm not doing, or seriously thinking of doing, any self harm, so there is that for now. Not sure if I'll keep this safe if this continue though.\n \nCan this fit in some kind of depression? I'm just not sure anymore.\n \nSorry for the long post, and for no TL;DR. I hope I'm not infringing any sub rules, and thank you for keep reading until the end.\n \nI think I just  needed to put this out after some hard days.",

            "selftext": "sorry for length I don\u2019t rly expect anybody to read all this I just need to at least type it out.\n\nI just moved to university 2 hours away from my hometown, my boyfriend of 5 years lives in this city and my friend from my hometown also lives with me and is studying the same subject as me at uni so I\u2019m not alone but I feel it more than ever. I have no friends, even though I have my friend and my boyfriend, my friend isn\u2019t a close friend but we haven\u2019t spent a lot of time together and it isn\u2019t the type of friendship where I can knock on her door crying because I\u2019m having suicidal thoughts. My boyfriend lol.. I feel more distant from him than ever and no matter how much I talk about things to him nothing changes, the relationship feels dead, he loves and cares about me and I love and care for him but it\u2019s at that point where it\u2019s been so long you get settled and stuck in your old ways. If I say I\u2019m depressed or want to kill myself I\u2019m not taken seriously.\n\nI had a job for 3 months in a spa doing massage (I\u2019m a beauty therapist), I only ever worked weekends and could never see my boyfriend and 8 hours of back massages back to back (no pun intended) was very fucking tedious. I got offered a new position in a salon where I\u2019ll be doing nails which is what I love to do, but now I\u2019ve been offered the job and handed in my notice at the spa and I don\u2019t even want the new job anymore. My new manager expects me to work at the salon when I have a break from uni, she said we can\u2019t book holidays in December/summer/Easter which is the only time I get off from uni, so basically I can\u2019t go home to see my family I have to work. She expects me to do extra hours, even though the reason I applied for the job was because it\u2019s 16 hours and works around uni. Thinking about having to go to this new job is enough to make me want to kill myself.\n\nMy flat mates never leave their rooms, 2 boys seem nice I sometimes see them and speak to them. But I was hoping to make some close friends, even the other girls on my course don\u2019t really seem like I could ever have a close friendship with them but maybe that\u2019s just me being judgemental and narrow minded. I didn\u2019t even want to go uni, I just did it so 1. I could finally get a job in the beauty industry cos I\u2019m from a small town where there are no jobs and 2. Be closer to my boyfriend (how ironic that I feel more distant from him than ever).\n\nI miss my mum, my dad, my grandma, sister, I miss my home and familiar surroundings, I miss my own room and laying in bed not having to worry about starting a new job and not being able to have time off from that job. My manager basically contracted me to 16 hours but is going to ask me to work extra all the time, or at least that\u2019s what she\u2019s making out. And she\u2019s very intimidating to say no to. I wish I kept my old job, it was shit but at least my manager was lovely.\n\nSo I\u2019m in the 2nd biggest city in England on my own, at 2:31am, doing a uni course I was never even bothered about doing, starting a new job I don\u2019t even want, with no friends, a boyfriend who thinks I\u2019m saying I want to die just for the sake of saying it (even if he took me seriously he\u2019d just say \u201csame\u201d even though he always talks about how happy he is in life atm). I am just sick of nobody listening to me and nobody realising how lonely I am, nobody asking how I am. I almost want to kill myself just so I have a way out from all of this shit, and also so they will finally take me seriously or realise how fucking lonely I really am. \n\nI have an online friend, I\u2019ve never met him, all he does is argue with me. I tell him lots of personal things, I wish I could tell him how I want to die or hurt myself without being embarrassed. He argues with me about how I am in a really preferable situation compared to him cos I go uni and work and have a boyfriend and he doesn\u2019t do much of anything right now. I tell him he doesn\u2019t realise how lonely n unhappy I am, he doesn\u2019t say much in response. I could scream, nobody is listening to me.",

I told her I wasn't able to come in and an hour later she came back with a termination notice saying how I didn't fit the needs of the company. I was on my 17th day in a row working 9am-5pm with no days off in between or even a break on the 8 hour shifts. I'm heartbroken and have never felt so alone in my life than I do right now.

            "selftext": "First time here &amp; I\u2019m not sure if this is the right place to post but I have severe mental issues mostly stemming from anxiety and depression issues. Sometimes I\u2019m ok, and sometimes I\u2019m not. Lately I haven\u2019t been okay... And I need help and don\u2019t know how to help myself so here\u2019s a lengthy post of me trying to ask for advice. \n\nI saw a psychiatrist for the anxiety who prescribed  Methotrimepreazine but told me to follow up with my family dr after and discharged me. The med he prescribed is extremely sedating and I can\u2019t function at work when taking it. They don\u2019t want me to take Ativan because they feel it is not good to take long term &amp; addictive but it\u2019s the only one I have found \u201cworks\u201d when I have bad panic coming on and still need to perform (I work at a high paced job that is super taxing and requires me to be ON all the time).  I went to follow up with my dr today and he got really aggressive about it and basically said I can\u2019t help you - you need antidepressants go to the hospital if you need immediate assistance. I\u2019ve been to emerge for psych and it can be upwards of 12 hrs waiting time and if you aren\u2019t basically sitting there with a knife at your throat they\u2019ll write you an antidepressant script and send you on your way or make you sit down with a social worker who overuses validating statements and patronizes the shit out of you. It\u2019s not my first rodeo with that. So I\u2019m going to wait to get another referral to the shrink and talk to him again when I can but it always goes back to needing to be medicated. My issue is I have severe memory issues and cannot take the meds on time I always screw them up and then end up all messed up and I absolutely hate how they make me feel. I guess I\u2019m posting because I think my fear/dislike of being on medication full time is what causes me to avoid getting the help I need and then all my doctors are frustrated with me and tell me they can\u2019t help me. Is there any way around this? The one med I know helps me and that I don\u2019t abuse they won\u2019t give me, so I\u2019m lost and am so confused and don\u2019t know how to get out. I have tried every antidepressant out there and they all make me feel like a zombie and awful and it Robs me of my \u201cgood days\u201d as I\u2019m not always like this.. I feel like a weird case because I have severe depression/anxiety/social anxiety but I am also very high functioning and extroverted so even my mental problems don\u2019t make sense. \n\nMost recently I developed a new fun symptom that I\u2019ve never had where I am literally missing hours of my day at work and not know what I\u2019ve worked on. I\u2019m falling behind and people are getting angry with me and I\u2019m probably going to get fired for it but I can\u2019t concentrate and am having really strange lapses in memory that are causing a lot of mistakes and issues. Ex. Recently during a meeting I forgot how to cut and paste while I was on the big screen in front of all my colleagues and Everyone was looking at me like wtf is wrong with this girl and now I am having anxiety every single meeting I have fearing it will happen again. My doc says \u2018well depression causes memory issues..\u2019 but this doesn\u2019t seem like normal depression fog that I\u2019m used to.. \n\nTLDR: I\u2019m so depressed I don\u2019t really feel like I have the will to live anymore. But I am so afraid of death I wouldn\u2019t/couldn\u2019t kill myself. So now I\u2019m in this stuck phase where I don\u2019t want to be alive but I don\u2019t want to be dead either and I have no idea how to get out. \n\nMaybe I haven\u2019t found the right medication or the right doctor, but as I said I\u2019ve seen a lot of doctors and been on a ton of meds so at this point I feel like giving up. If you made it this far thanks for listening. If anyone has any advice I really need it.",

But, I honestly dont know how to move on from this. A lot of people say I'm too retarded to change and actively avoid me.\n\nIt hurts, but I'm able to realize that I'm severely underdeveloped. I think my depression made it even worse because over time, I started losing my grasp on reality. It started to affect my cognition, so I had a hard time thinking or understanding things.\n\nI was also very forgetful.\n\nI feel like a fucking child, honestly.

So naturally i started tying my self worth to my grades and I would get discouraged and feel dumb whenever I saw someone with higher grades than I. Every time I show him my report card it\u2019s always met with \u201cyou did pretty good but you don\u2019t do this enough\u201d \u201c you need to be doing this\u201d\u201dis this it?\u201d\n    A few years back I asked him why he treated my like this and it was because \u201ceventually I will have to move out and marry into another family so I will need to be smart and good at chores\u201d he\u2019s one of those um, traditional African parents that thinks daughters are for marrying into other families and birthing children.\n\n\nI remember the exact day when I started feeling depressed. 3rd grade. I came home crying from school because for the first time I had failed a test. My mom said it was fine and I begged her not to show it to my dad. My parents noticed changes in my behavior and I told them I was always feeling very sad.  Then my dad, person that he is, says, \u201cbut why? I buy you everything you want, you have everything you want.\u201d So.....yeah.\n\nHe also thinks he\u2019s entitled to my shit. He broke his phone charger early this year and has been leeching off of mine ever since and refuses to just buy a new one. He always demands for my shit like it\u2019s his at the  most  inconvenient times, I know if I say no, I\u2019ll just get beat up. I can\u2019t even stand up for myself because he can not express anger without beating me. A few months back my younger brother hit me like he always does and I was in a bad mood and I hit him back. My dad went crazy, slapped me multiple times, and made me kneel down in front of everyone. He acted as everything was normal the next day and I still can\u2019t make eye contact with him.  \n\nHe is constantly finding ways to belittle me, \u201coh you didn\u2019t do your chores today? Why did I give birth to such a lazy daughter? You wear this to school? Have you no decency?\u201d \u201cYou got a b? You used to be so smart!\u201d And the wonders why I\u2019m closer to my mom more than him and why I feel sad when around him, saying \u201cI don\u2019t see why you should be sad, you live in America.\u201d\nI want to stand up for myself sometimes but I\u2019m just afraid what will happen. I don\u2019t know what to do",

I value my life too much though, so I wouldn't ever let that happen. I just really needed to vent about some stuff. \n\nI keep having these thoughts at random times how one day no matter what I'll die and it scares me so much. I used to have a therapist and she would just say obvious stuff and told me how everyone fears death and it's normal, that there is no point talking about it. I can't afford one now, nor do I want one. \n\nWell, when I get these thoughts I just get this strong uncomfortable feeling in my chest and sometimes it feels like nothing is real. I am an atheist and while I feel freedom to live my life how I want, not how others expect me to, at the end of the day I'm just scared. Scared that one day I will never be able to feel or think or touch anything again. The worst quote I've seen a lot is \"well you couldn't feel before you were born\", well now I exist and I can most certainly feel and I don't want that taken away from me. It's a normal human thing I know, but I've spent too many night crying over this when I suddenly think about it.  I'm only 20, I'm too young to feel this way. I've had these thoughts since I was 14, 14! Or when I realise people I care about will have to eventually die one day too and no one will ever know a person like them ever again, because they are unique to this world it makes me feel even worse. \n\nMost days I feel too apathetic to do anything, I have hobbies(which I enjoy sometimes), I have a few friends and a lovely boyfriend. I just can't get myself to do things. I like the things I do maybe once every 2 months? For a day or two or something I will feel some motivation and joy. But most days I just don't care about anything(or anyone except the people closest to me, to be honest). \n\nIt doesn't help in this country a lot of people have to work 2 jobs to be able to support themselves on their own. I don't have to do such a thing for now and might not have to, but just the thought that it's a thing is insane. No one should have to work two jobs just to be able to survive.",

            "selftext": "I have been struggling with depression for nearly all my life. I am now 25. At first I didn't know it was depression and I basically assumed I was just feeling emotional pain. I grew up in an orphanage and both my parents are dead. I dropped out of college because I couldn't get any treatment due to financial hardship. When I was 15 years old I got a scholarship to study in an international college due to my intelligence and academic talents. When the college discovered about my HIV status they terminated my scholarship. \n\nI was devastated for years. At first I thought there was no problem being positive, but after I was met with discrimination I started to understand the world I lived in. I was born with HIV and depression, I didn't pray for it. Living in an institution didn't help either. \n\nAfter dropping out of college due to financial strains I tried to find some online work.  I spent a large amount of time on the internet till I was lucky to find work as a freelancer. I specialized in data entry and did a little bit of content writing. However one fateful day I couldn't stand up. My back was in pain. I couldn't even go to the toilet. There was a problem with my disk. For a couple of months I ate through my savings trying to get medical treatment. The doctors said there was a problem with my disk. After I recovered I was bankrupt with no friend, family or money. Now I live in absolute poverty. I can't even feed myself. \n\nI am sick and tired of waking up everyday and being in pain. I just want it all to end. I have basically no support structure and I want all the pain and suffering in my life to end. Its hard to come to terms with the fact that I might have to take my own life just to stop my suffering, however I have made peace with this reality. Not everyone was born to have a decent life. Its true that \"when days are dark friends are few\". \n\nI am plagued by everything that is bad on this planet and I think death might be a better alternative at least it will be over.",

She basically left me and gave no reason other than she was unhappy. Couldn\u2019t tell me why though. So I\u2019ve been kind of a wreck since that happened. \n\nAnyway I live a totally normal life at work. I joke around, I am talkative with everyone, I go out to lunch with others, and my job performance hasn\u2019t suffered after what I\u2019ve been through. However, after work when I get home I want to do nothing at all. I tell myself to go do something, anything! But I never do. I am constantly sad. After being so used to having a companion to talk to and do things with it\u2019s hard to want to do anything now. All I do is sit on my couch and stare at the tv or literally just lay there and do nothing. I have almost just started crying multiple times because of everything that has happened recently to me. All of my thoughts and feelings just build up. \n\nSome days are better than others but overall it\u2019s miserable. Most all of my friends are married and have kids etc.. so I don\u2019t really have people I can hang with during the week. It\u2019s really tough on me because I keep telling myself to do things. Things I once enjoyed like video games I haven\u2019t touched in weeks. Playing golf doesn\u2019t give me the same satisfaction it once did. \n\nI\u2019m no expert on mental health or anything but I feel like this is a mild form of depression. Figured I\u2019d come here and get yalls opinions or just talk about it. Thanks.",

            "selftext": "Somewhere in a low socio-economic area of Sydney stood a shabby trackside apartment, the kind some people are vaguely grateful to have taken out a mortgage for. The bleach-white, paper thin walls hardly muffled the chirping of birds who'd woken up to another sunny day. Their joyful cries sounded far off as if from a place unreachable.\n\nThe man in the bleak trackside apartment who had observed all this was hopelessly struggling to keep hold of sleep. It'd been at least 15 hours now since he collapsed into his uncomfortable fold-up, spring-laid bed. He surrendered, irritated, to the rays of morning light, which crept up from the most unwelcome angle and became progressively more annoying as the morning drawled on.\n\nThe man, who hesitated to even call himself a man, was staring now at the sterile white ceiling, thinking unpleasant thoughts. The birds had stopped singing now and the sun would only get more intolerably hot and bright. There was a deep, humid silence which represented sheer loneliness. Anyone who thought oneself mentally well-adjusted had shuffled off to work, leaving him alone to endure the rest of the day.\n\nBut a thump and a clatter reminded him that he wasn't alone. Someone hadn't gone to work today. The very same person who'd thought it wise to take out a mortgage on the depressingly flimsy and bleak trackside apartment in which they resided. It was his mother, the person to whose patronage he, a 26 year old man, was helplessly bound, lest he should spend each and every one of his supposedly precious days pretending to enjoy being a complacent sycophant.\n\nThe man crept into the kitchen, hoping to sneak back to his cell a cup of coffee and a buttered piece of bread before he was discovered and harassed. Too late: a deer caught in headlights. The joyless, neurotic hag, who was always unashamedly spiteful, had made brisk pace for the kitchen and in her characteristically piercing tone which never failed to demonstrate her irritation, abruptly questioned as to whether there were any eggs. Normally, in virtually any other scenario, he'd have been more than happy to assist with her query, but faced with such unapologetic disrespect, he mumbled a quick \"I don't know\", gave up on buttering his toast and immediately made his way back to solitary confinement. \n\nMaking sure to dominate the atmosphere with sullen pettiness, she called after him \"and you're using my cup for tea!\" The man made it back to his whitewashed cage, closed the door behind him and with some relief embraced the discomfort of his uneven mattress. He might have felt secure in his discomfort had she not followed him, opened that squeeky door and in her horribly shrill voice, expressive of endless vexation, reprimanded him for hoarding on his windowsill all of three tea cups, including the one he'd just gotten. As that soulless banshee finally took her leave, almost succeeding in closing that door behind her, which seemed to be made of the cheapest of plywood, the man involuntarily shuddered and reluctantly began to plan his escape. He had intended to wallow today in silence and that dream had promptly been squashed as soon as he'd noticed the presence of that unpleasant woman who at this very moment was needlessly making a commotion in the kitchen, as if bored and making her own drama. She made sure to make a show of gathering glass bottles as if to say \"all you had to do for me to not be horrible today was take out the rubbish you needlessly created by shamefully drinking alcohol\". \n\nThe man laid in silence, not bothering to drink his tea, and watched a small insect steadily traverse the ceiling. The prospect of brushing his teeth flitted through his head but he dared not leave his cell again. He listened blankly to the creaking of the apartment and the occasional far off chirruping of some bird who must have slept in. He apathetically endured the dull aches in his head and throughout his body, vaguely wishing for any reason to rise from his bed but all the same not really caring. Trapped, he thought of reading a book but couldn't be bothered. Instead, he drearily pursued scraps of sleep and began to daydream. As he waited for that witch of anxiety to leave, he surrendered to morbid listlessness.",

I decided that I will give it one more day.  She didn\u2019t even know how I was feeling or what was going through my head. It\u2019s crazy how my friend has no clue, but she saved my life...by just being herself. I\u2019m not saying I\u2019ll be okay tomorrow but I\u2019m not saying I won\u2019t be. I\u2019m going to take it one day at a time. I made it through today and that\u2019s what matters, I\u2019m still here. It\u2019s truly the littlest things that are important.",

I've lost interest in most things I used to enjoy. I struggle with school every day and have no motivation to do any work. The problem is that I absolutely despise talking to anyone about my problems at all, like I just cannot do it. My parents wouldn't understand how I'm feeling either because I tried talking to them before but they just complained and told me I'm lazy. But I think it's more than just laziness. I'm not confident enough to go to a doctor about it either. I feel I'm stuck in this painful cycle and it doesn't help that I can only manage to get 4 - 5 hours sleep every night.\n\nAnyone else feel the same?",

There has been tons of times when there was something I wanted to have so I can wear to school but then I think I might be judge cause I look ugly in it or cause I thought it looked to nice for me. It been 8 days since I have cut but there have been times that I have come close to cutting. It hard to resist from cutting so I stay up at night cause if I get tired it will get harder to resist cause then my mind just goes to bad thought and I want get better so bad. I just want go to my old self the happy one. Today a friend of mine asked me where someone is the person they asked me about it let's just say they did something bad I wanted to cry so bad cause I had a flashback. I told him that he went back home and he won't be coming back I would have cried but I didn't want seem like a loser so I decide to just hold it in. It getting harder to focus on school i'm always so tired anyways I know this was kind of long well I think it was i'm not sure bye.\n\n**I'm sorry if this was boring**",

I've struggled so much with intrusive toughts, you'd not believe... \n\nSince a few days ago I realised how shitty my life is getting once again.\n-I'm not taking the shit medication my doctor prescribed me for OCD (0,35mL risperdal).\n-I really want to get fit, I mean really fit with nice looking abs and muscles. I've spent over 100\u20ac in supplements which I think are helping only 1% (creatine and protein powder for muscle growth, green coffee and 5-htp for weight loss).\nAnd I still have this depressing belly fat wich prevents abs from showing up.\n-I try not to eat between lunch and dinner which makes my depressive symptoms worse than ever.\n-the only girls I'll probably date/have sex with in next months is in a menage/threesome with another guy (he's cute so he attracts the females then we fuck them. No homo shit.) \n-I still think a lot about the girl that left me 3 years ago because she was from another country (on the opposite side of the world)\n\nThis is not even near of what I want to my life.\n\nI want:\n-a nice body\n-a girlfriend\n-not to feel depressed\n\n\nPlease I want these 3 things for my life.

            "selftext": "I dont even know how to explain it anymore. Even if i were to tell someone whats happening i wouldnt be able to in a way that i feel effectively gets my point across. I thought about tryung to tell eother my Band teacher of my History teacher, but i dont want the same thing as last year to happen again. I told my Art teacher last year, but nothing came of it. I know he cared, but i guess theres only so much a teacher can do with that sort of thing. Ultimately its up to the parent, but more importantly yourself, to get real change. The problem with that though... is part of me just doesnt care enough about me to want to get better.\n\nAside from all that though, regardless if it would actually help, i dont know if telling a teacher is even the right thing to do. Because im so worried that this would be just another thing to burden them with. Teachers have lives and families and work to worry about. None of them need the added concern and stress of dealing with me. \n\nI also thought about maybe trying to see a therapist, but I'm afraid of that too. I've gone and seen therapists before when I was younger because my mom forced me to, but none of them really set well with me. I know it's their job to ask questions, but they have always just been so pushy and got so upset if I didn't answer. As if I didn't matter and they were only there for the money and because it's their job. I also just can't feel comfortable telling a complete stranger with a notepad things I wouldn't even tell close friends, regardless if it's confidential. Aside from all this, therapy is also really expensive, and my mom is already having financial troubles as it is. I wouldn't want to be an added hassle and stress her out more than I already have.\n\nI also feel like I'm losing any friends I may have had. I find myself getting overly annoyed when they say repeated phrases like,\"Same\" or \"mood\" or things like that that are so commonly used that they have began to lose any meaning. And I know that's just the way Society works right now, and it's not any of their fault, but I just can't help but think none of them actually care what's wrong. Not anymore at least. I've told some people before about everything, and I mean everything, but I guess it's just become old news, and unless any of it, directly or indirectly, involves or concerns them, then it's just not important enough.\n\nBut maybe I guess that's the thing. Maybe it isn't important enough. What makes me think I'm special? What gives me the right to think any of this actually matters? Nothing. I am no more special than anyone else. In fact I'm much less. I am nothing.\n\nI've realized I'm out of options, and no new opportunities have risen to give me a way out. I'm left with two choices. A, I could tell someone, maybe a teacher, and I would do another wellness check the police and have my mom freak out on me and threaten send me to a mental hospital downstate again, and this time probably go through with it, or B, just continue the way I am and I guess ignore everything.\n\nThere is... a 3rd choice. Choice C. I could just give up. Completely. But... I don't know I guess I'm not quite there yet, but I have a feeling I might be soon.\n\nI just don't know what to do...",

            "selftext": "I have been active on this subreddit for quite a while now, simply looking at other people's posts. Today I just decided to share my feelings about my life.\n\nI am a 25-year-old boy. I have never been in a relationship. I am shy and introverted. I spend a lot of my day listening to music. The music triggers daydreams and I keep seeing myself as a much more confident person in those daydreams. I hate getting back to reality. I am scared of getting rejected by people so I don't talk much or say anything. I find it hard to relate to people as I don't do or like things that most people like. I overthink everything so I am very slow in making decisions. I am not witty or funny and I am a rather serious person so most people don't want to talk to me except for work-related matters. When I try to be funny or just let loose I become too childlike. Even now I am scared to talk to most girls fearing that I will get rejected or be thought of as needy.\n\nI have friends but they have very different tastes in things and its become apparent in the last few years and I am starting to become more and more distant from them. My best friend is someone who has the exact same issues as me and he is the only one I can talk to about my problems. His situation is not getting any better so I feel even more depressed talking to him.\n\nI consume a lot of content just to take my mind of life. I watch a lot of movies, tv shows and read loads of articles and posts on Reddit. I read and watch a lot of motivational articles &amp; videos almost every day. They give me temporary boosts to live on but after a while, I just get back to hating myself. \n\nThe only thing good for me is that I am financially well off. I am a decent coder and earn well. When I was really motivated a few years back I self-learned to code. But nowadays I think the only reason I do it is that it's one of the only things I am good at. The value of money is starting to fade away and I have been spending recklessly for the last few months just for small doses of pleasure. \n\nMy loneliness is completely demotivating me. I am trying to be as productive as I can but even there I fail. I just end up working a few hours a day just for the sake of my clients' satisfaction and then go back to mindless consumption. I had so many dreams and aspirations of one day building a cool application etc but none of it seem to matter to me anymore. I can't understand my own feelings and don't understand what motivates me.\n\nI freelance and been working from home for quite a long time. This also somewhat makes me feel lonely but again I am scared to get into a full-time job just for the sake of having come company. Lately, I am beginning to think that the only reason I work is to take my mind of everything else in life. My work is the only identity that I have. People only know me as a computer geek as I just spend all my time being in front of a computer. \n\nI don't want to visit any psychologist or psychiatrist as I am scared of spooking my parents. My parents already have their own set of problems. My mom especially gets anxious easily so I am scared of burdening her with this issue.\n\nLast few weeks I have been getting thoughts of suicide. To just end it all and not face any of these problems. I do have glimmers of hope that maybe things will get better, hopes that some external push will help me overcome myself as I see in so many movies. But I don't know. \n\nI keep telling myself at least I have a roof over my head, at least I get good food every day, at least I get to travel, at least I have money, at least I have loving parents, but no matter what I just can't overcome this loneliness and depression.\n\nI am very sorry for the long post. I have been keeping these feelings inside me for a long time now and I just had to share it somewhere.",

            "selftext": "*I'm not a Reddit user, I was stumbling upon some posts and thought that maybe someone could give me an insight and help me out. What im about to write is gonna be very difficult to understand, its very long and im sorry if im taking time out of your day, I had to put all the emotions bottled up away to write this. I would appreciate any help, and I hope that someone who suffers like me can relate. It took me a bit to write this as I broke down many times. This is what goes through my head everyday. Its a story that people keep telling me to move on but I can't . It is my story, and the explanation of my Anxiety, depression and suicidal behaviour. I wanna note that *I HAVE NEVER BEEN PART OF A GANG OR ANY SORT OF CRIME RELATED INCIDENTS* and I've always looked out for people, even if they didn't do the same. As mentioned I want somebody to give me their insight, but I want this to reach as many people that went through similar pain to understand that its not about others, it's about you, anger and hate is not the answer. Fight these demons.\n\nMY STORY: In the entirety of my life violence has resided within my timeline, at the young age of 6 I moved in the western world from a country of conflict so I guess you could say im not a stranger to stressful environment, my family was very Catholic, I lost faith at the age of 10. Throughout my life people have always been racist towards me, my father was very violent towards me, to the point were I would get my head driven into a wall for telling him to stop talking to me. He cheated on my mother when I was only 1, while my brother was in the womb of my mother and again when I was 16, ever since then my mother has completely lost it. Not every issue is because of them, its because of me, or so they say, and I cant lie, sometime I'm convinced. I have contemplated suicide hundreds of times, I've even voiced it out recently to my friends and family, they always mentioned that I am a coward for chosing that way. I was always getting bullied, i was just a 5ft 4 guy with a chubby face, I wanna mention that i was getting bullied at home too by family, i remember I got mad at a game and smacked by desk and my father rushed in my room and we went into a full fist fight. Rage consumed me 24/7 wasn't until I was 16 that I hit 6ft 1 in such a short amount of time. I started boxing and I weighed 150lb and ripped. People distanced themselves away from me. One bully became my best friend, and I protected him with my life. I wanna note that I will throw my life away to save any other human being even if they are just strangers, some of you may think im just saying that but it has been applied and gratefully I'm still alive to wish the end of my existence for tomorrow. I found peace in art, paintings and tattoos at the age of 16, I started drawing and getting tattooed, and wanted to become the best tattoo artist, but no one supported me. At home, my own family distanced themselves from me. My own mom has mentioned multiple times after arguments that if she knew she was gonna have me, she wouldn't have married my Dad, I mention that to her and she always says it was just a joke. I don't talk to my dad anymore he bounced after getting his citizenship. After people constantly calling me a failure, I envisioned myself as one and sometimes still do to this day, I've been working constantly since I was 14 so im no stranger to working, but because of my life decisions I am not taken seriously, my friends use me for their own protection, because their idiotic logic is that \"nobody will mess with a 6ft 2 jacked guy\", I counteract that saying when I always use words instead of fists to save the situation. All my friends are heavy gamblers, one of them is always intrigued with crime and is probably gonna get himself hurt or even killed if he goes down that road. At 18 my life has almost been taken away 3 times by the hands of others, it seems demons follow me, everywhere I go. My rage resurged when a man came up to me, probably on drugs pointed a gun to my neck, and all I did was laugh like a maniac in his face, the look on his face said it all, he pulled back the hammer and I broke out of the humanity many people seem to find comfort in. I accepted death. It didn't matter I was a failure to everybody and a bodyguard to the ones close to me, I never had a girlfriend, I didn't even have the chance to accomplish anything, and worst of all, my dream of being tattoo artist faded away instantly. He pulled back and said \"you're lucky I don't dome you right back to where you came from\". This was at 18, my life had been threatened before but never with that much emotion, I became an alcoholic, I would sleep 4hrs a night and on my free time, I would try to find this individual and serve my justice, knowing that if it was served I wouldn't be alive. I would train until I couldn't feel my my body and was shaking as if I was going through a seizure, all to attain my vengeance, I even went as far as asking some contacts in a very \"unethical\" manner for information. In my life ive tried ending it atleast 10 times that i can remember, everyone close knows about all of this. Ive been to 3 therapists and none could help me. I needed purpose, I let go of all anger, all emotion, at the time ive only been around women who always used me as a \"purse\"(tool for attention), cheated on me or were in some shit (connections with crime), one of them almost got me to walk in a dangerous situation. I was blinded, I never knew what it felt like to be with a real woman who cares for me as much as I would. I always tried helping my friends and the girls I had a \"thing\" with to better themselves to this day I don't even bother making eye contact with another female. I became an empty shell. I looked into joining the army so that I could give hope to others, but not even a year later something clicked. My mom was so proud of me, people finally began thinking I was worth something. And then it all went to shit when I realized that I wasn't doing it for me and only to prove myself to others, I wanted to become a Special Forces operator so I can attempt to die not being a failure and if I survived I still wouldn't be. It was a suicidal mission, all my buddies use me as me for their own image so why wouldn't I die protecting those who defend our country. But eventually I redecided to pursue my artwork, I became way better than before, but with all hope comes an inivetiable despair. Now my family lost their shit, they treated me worst than they did before. I overheard my brother tell his friends that I should've went through with the military and died for something atleast, i took that with a grain of salt tbh. I wanna note that my anger issues don't help as I always retaliate, it keeps me alive because if I don't make any contact with anyone, im just an empty vessel for people to hate on for every little step I take. One night my mother saw me trying to leave at night, in my mind this was it, my final hours, looking at her beg me to stay alive, was one of the most fucked up things I've ever witnessed and like previously mentioned, im no stranger to stressful situations. I didn't want to tell her that she was one of the many reasons why I wanted to take my own life she still doesn't know, she's not very aware of the action she takes, and I still can't blame her, shes been through alot and I was a hard kid to raise. I'm sorry if I wasn't who you wanted me to be mom, I still love her despite our relationship.\n\n*PRESENT* At this moment im planning to move out, pursue the career I wanted (tattoo artist) to from the get go. People around me still hate me for my decisions but its fine IT'S MY LIFE NOT THEIRS\". My friends are my family, but all they do is treat me like shit, have this retarded ideology, I catch them saying alot of racist things, they treat people like shit especially women. It disgusts me, I got one good friend hes helped my perception alot, I am completely sober with the occasional cigarette from time to time. I look to help people achieve their goal physique, I help out the ones in need expecting nothing, it truly puts a smile on me, But like mentioned, no hope comes without an eventual despair. I wanted to write the past to explain what goes on through my head now despite the progress. I have constant suicidal thoughts, My paranoia has heightened to a level you cant even imagine, I don't even point my phone camera towards me because I always think somebody is watching. I have constant weird nightmares so I don't really like to sleep. I can't talk to any women, because I see them as the way alot of friends see them as \"objects\", and my gentle behaviour impedes me from finding a companion, I don't stand up for the good anymore, it feels like I gave up completely, I'm still a bodyguard to most friends, even the random ones I met at school would only invite me to gatherings for this \"secure environment\", btw its engrained in me to protect everyone for some reason, maybe these people see that. My own bestfriend ive known for about 10 years, the one that witnessed all of this, my high school bully, who's like half my size now, (I question if karma is real \ud83e\udd14) the one who truly made me smile despite our history, became an addicted gambler, constantly talking about how he would harm people for crossing him, even he, now, treats me like an inferior individual, always questioning if I'm gay (I got nothing wrong with any homosexual individual) or something because I can't even look at girls. Im socially anxious, can't talk to anybody without looking away or thinking the worst, I don't even have any social media. I used to be \"macho\" but now I couldn't care for my existence, so I sit down and break down to comfort me, it makes me feel good for some reason. If you managed to read through this, thank you and I'm sorry, I know its long, I just genuinely wanted to speak out. I hope my life will change I wish to be at peace with my past and in comfort in the future.",

            "selftext": "Hi!  \nSo this text might be a huge mess, and if turns out to be so, I appologize, but I am a mess myself, so I guess it\u00b4ll just be a reflection of my state.  \n\n\nI fell like I\u00b4m a piece of shit pretty much most of the time. Like, there are times where I\u00b4m visibly shaken down and can\u00b4t quite hide it, those are the times where I feel it most, the sadness, the frustration and the anger. The rest of the times I\u00b4m either extremely numb or I\u00b4m minimally functional and quite normal. I do have highs of happiness tho.   \nI have these fears in my head that I\u00b4ll never be worth anything, that I\u00b4m just human garbage really. I feel like I\u00b4ll never be able to do anything productive with my life. I try to imagine my future and the minute i try to think of something good happening I completely destroy it, I just can not believe that I have anything good waiting for me. I can\u00b4t see a good future for me and I don\u00b4t really believe in it.   \nI try to do things (like drawing and painting and animating) that I\u00b4m supposed to like, or at least liked before, and I can\u00b4t complete anything. I have this imense fear of failing or doing anything that won\u00b4t be as good as i wished it was, because then, well, then I\u00b4m confronted with the reallity that I really fucking am a wortheless piece of shit that\u00b4s not good at anything at all and has absulutly no future.   \nAll these people around me doing woderfull shit and being good people and I just feel like I\u00b4m floating and I feel like I can\u00b4t breath, and I feel afraid, and sad and so alone and doomed to be this awful way.  \nI don\u00b4t want to die, I\u00b4m not suicidal, but I do wish so many times I wasn\u00b4t born at all or that I could just disapear, vanish in the air. When I do think about my future, and see myself with no hope at all I do think that I won\u00b4t be able to live a life of misery. \"Some people just weren\u00b4t meant for living\" I think to myself. I guess Im one of those people.  \nI have no passion for anything, and that scares me.   \nI hate myself, have days where I feel like an actuall monster, so so ugly, so so unrepairable.  \nMy family is a fucking mess and toxic as fuck. It\u00b4s not the worst, but fuck is it bad, and not helpfull at all.  \nI\u00b4m reallly introverted, and I\u00b4ve made my peace with it, but sometimes I do feel very lonely. I have a boyfriend, and he\u00b4s really good to me, but I feel like i can\u00b4t amount to him. I sometimes am afraid I\u00b4ll never be able to maintain a healthy relationship. I guess I\u00b4ll be just like my mother, fuck me. I\u00b4m constanly anxious about him, always have these thoughts that he\u00b4s going to cheat on me (even tho I\u00b4ve never been cheated on thank god), or meet someone else more interesting, someone better than me. I feel like I\u00b4m such a bad person, and I\u00b4m afraid I wont be able to keep up with him. Im always afraid of being left behind...   \n\n\nYou know how I really feel most of the times, I feel like Im on a limbo, never too sad, never too happy, just constantly stuck in a state of numbness, of not being able to connect with anything or anyone. I minimize every relationship I had and have. It all feels worthless and stupid. I constantly feel undecisive, and i feel like my brain is not working, like theres a fog inside of me. I dont have any strenght or passion. I dont have any willpower. I struggle to get out of bed. I m tired, exausted and I mostly feel stuck and pressured and so so so angry at my family and at my luck and circumstances. I dont know what to do. I cant concentrate or stick to anything at all. The only things I can do are like home tasks, everyday tasks.  \n\n\nJeez, I have so much shit going trough my head I cant even express half of it, but I\u00b4ve been coming here, on this thread, for sometime and seeing all these posts really makes me feel less alone. I don\u00b4t really have anyone to whom I can say this  shit bluntly so I thought I\u00b4d do it here.   \nI don\u00b4t know whats wrong with me, but i feel like something is definitely wrong. I\u00b4ve have been told to get help, but I feel quite helpless and I dont think anyone would validate my feelings... Most of the time I feel like I\u00b4m just being a bitch and that I should know better and just do better. But I dont, I can\u00b4t.   \nI\u00b4m sorry if I kept repeating myself.... my brains really are a mess. And sorry if there are any mistakes, i tried to make sure there wasn\u00b4t, but english is not my first language so... you get the point\n\nIf you are reading this: Thank you. A lot.  \n\n\nTLDR: Just venting out how I feel like a complete waste of space, how I have obssessive self-loathing and destructive thoughts that I cant controll",

I want to vent but when I start typing I usually end up deleting it. Everyone says they have no friends but I see them going out with people... I haven\u2019t left my house more than 10 times in the past 2 months. No one texts me or checks up on me. It sucks because I would do anything for someone in pain but I never get the same treatment. I watch everyone going out and working a job while enjoying life and I\u2019m just stuck in a black hole. Days melt into months. Medications never work. I\u2019ve tried 20 or thirty different meds including ketamine injections which works for most people. I cried my eyes out when I got my first ketamine injection and it didn\u2019t work after I watched countless experience videos on YouTube where people felt normal for once. It\u2019s as if I\u2019m not meant to be happy. I\u2019ve sobered up from drugs and alcohol after years of professionals telling me drugs were fucking up the chemicals in my brain.. even that didn\u2019t make a difference I just feel pain 24/7 now. My moms so proud of me for being sober but I don\u2019t feel an improvement at all. I had a week where I felt normal once. I realized you can be happy for absolutely no reason. It doesn\u2019t have to be a new material possession or a new relationship you can just be genuinely happy just because you\u2019re existing. That\u2019s how you\u2019re supposed to feel. Instead I dread my existence and pray for a freak accident. Another suicide attempt has been on my mind lately but I know I shouldn\u2019t go through with it. My dog sits in bed with me every day and snuggles while I\u2019m suffering and I look into his eyes and tear up knowing the inevitable that I won\u2019t be here in another few years. I keep telling myself I need to pull it together for him. I imagine having a small apartment and coming home from work to see him all happy to see me. A normal experience feels so impossible for me. He needs his mom to give him all the affection and treats he deserves. But what if I can\u2019t. I\u2019m not stable enough to hold down a job or have friendships but I\u2019m too sane to rot away in a psych ward it doesn\u2019t make sense. That\u2019s all I can think of to vent right now my mind has gone blank.",

Always tired, never happy not truly, no matter the circumstances. What\u2019s the point when your life is just working and drowning yourself in things to try and get away from it. Doesn\u2019t matter how much you sleep, or eat you\u2019re tired. Hang out with friends, maybe a brief moment of something. Then back to normal. What do you do when you can\u2019t smoke or drink enough to stop hurting? When the stress just won\u2019t go away. Why try when you don\u2019t feel alive. When the only you crave is sleep, which becomes more and more difficult to get. \n\nI\u2019ve done the pills, talked to people, positive thinking,  exercise. The pills \u201cwork\u201d if by work you mean turning you into a zombie. Walking around like life is some kinda dream, disconnected. \nTalking might ease it for a little bit but it alway comes back. Besides you can\u2019t talk to your friends anyways, no one likes to be brought down, and my problems are not theirs to deal with. Don\u2019t have money for a therapist, and just the thought of paying someone to listen to me complain irks me. You can force yourself to be positive, but it\u2019s a constant struggle. Leaving you lacking in every other area of your life. It\u2019s also not perfect and if you slip up you\u2019re back where you began. No matter what you do that fatigue and stress don\u2019t go away. \n\nSo why bother, when you\u2019re not even living a half life?",

            "selftext": "-TL;DR WARNING \n-WORLD'S SMALLEST VIOLIN WARNING \n\nAlmost my entire childhood was spent in isolation. I've struggled with ADHD, and SEVERE Anxiety, and I'm sure I have some form of Aspergers. My mentally ill mother would belittle me and make me feel worthless. I'd spend my entire childhood inside of my room playing video games instead of hanging out with the other kids, and after high school I left with only two friends. I spent my childhood letting my shyness take over and it prevented me from going out in the world and developing as a person.\n\nI went into the Army and was discharged for my ADHD,  falling into severe depression. Things finally improved for me when I met my girl friend. We've been together for 4 years, and was my only social life at that time. She was the only person I could truly connect with and talk to nonstop. She made me feel normal. It was a very loving relationship where she wanted to spend every moment she could with me. We even got to the point she said she wanted to be my wife. She did a lot for me and I think my social skills have really improved being with her.\n\nHowever... Things have taken a bad turn. She cheated on me and admitted she's now in love with this other person and left me for them. Losing her opened my eyes to how empty my life is. I don't really have anyone else to talk to and the loneliness has been really eating away at me. \n\nI'm currently working as an EMT for a shitty ambulance service. I thought it would be something interesting and would find good like-minded people for friendship, but even after a year I wasn't able to really connect to anyone beyond just surface level \"work buddy\". \nI miss my girlfriend and I hate being alone. I want to turn this around for me and end this chapter of isolation in my life.\n\nAnyone have a similar experience? Some advice would be nice.",

My social life is dead. Feeling so fucking anxious because of this and I cannot sleep.  I mean a month and a half of school has already passed and I still haven\u2019t met anyone from my class outside of school and I haven\u2019t really clicked with anyone either.  You know what? If the people in my class only wanna talk to me in school I don\u2019t wanna put down the time and energy required to form a social bond, they obviously don\u2019t wanna be my friend. \n\nWhat makes me feel really bad is that I thought that everyone in my class hated me. But during  the last week a bunch of them have texted me saying that they miss me and want me to come back. I regret this so fucking much but actually I don\u2019t. I just don\u2019t know what to do I can\u2019t take decisions like this I can\u2019t handle the uncertainty like wtf happens now?? Just wish I could be hit by a car and get into a come for a year or so.\n\nAlso my only friend has basically left me completely for the ones in her new school. She always priorities them above me. \n\nAlso it feels like I\u2019m waisting my youth on feeling like this and only being home, never meeting people or having fun or doing something productive.",

Everyone I talk to (mostly proffesionals) tend to either avoid answering or just always gives me the same answer. \"Things will eventually get better\" or \"you're just in a bad spot right now\". Is that it then? That's all I'm supposed to go off of? My life so far has been a consistent downwards trend, only varying when it comes to what degree I've been spiralling downwards. And now I'm just expected that everything will just do a jump and a dance and my life will magically flip itself back? I honestly feel like I'm slowly drowning. Not a irrational struggle but rather how one slowly struggles more and more to stay afloat and keep their head over the water. Every day my body feels just a little more heavy to drag around. Every day the food tastes a little \"grayer\" as I force myself to eat. I live in Norway where we have a solid welfare system, but at this point I almost feel bad for wasting their time. I struggle more and more to find a reason to keep going, repeating to myself that it will one day get better, hollow words repeated in a mocking fashion ad tedium. Is there anything more out there? Is my only hope some vague promise that it might get better? I really don't think about killing myself anymore. Even the pain seems numb and distant. I just can't seem to find any more strength. I can see my own end, an apathic end where I'll slowly finding even the energy to stand up in the morning, eat when im hungry, fight against all of the doubts weighing me down. I'm not at the edge yet, but I'm steadily slipping closer day by day. What am I supposed to other than just keep going for (I'd say I have a solid five more months before I won't be able to get out of bed)",

            "selftext": "You know the feeling of when you trip and get a small rush when you almost fall but you save yourself? Or when you're falling asleep, and suddenly you remember you forgot something important and you get a cold rush and a sinking feeling? Does anyone get that with, like, sudden feeling of depression?\n\nI just had to move to a different country (basically I used to live in the country of my biggest dreams, but for reasons beyond my control, had to leave, and there is no other place I want to live other than that country). I graduated with a mediocre gpa in a major that has no job prospects without at least masters/phd, which I plan to get but can't for at least next two years. I can't find a job, I'm unqualified for everything I find, and if that's not enough, I have no work experience despite being a grown adult with a college degree. I have a girlfriend who I have been with for 3 years, but she has told me she can't see me in her future, and that her love for me has shrunk, and thatshe has thought about breaking up and feels like she will want to in the near-ish future. I am madly in love with her (or just dependent on her, I can't tell... but either way, heartbreak would affect me just the same) and now we're also long distance. Apart from her, I have not a single friend. I find it incredibly hard to make a friend, and my gf confirms it is hard to befriend me, and I have no social skills due to my awkwardness. We only hung out with her friends who never became my friends.\n\nSo here I am, in a new foreign country, new city (I can speak the language and I like the city itself -- but when I'm a visitor, not \"forced\" to be there), without my girlfriend who is my only friend, who I am constantly scared is on the brink of stopping loving me, with no other friends, no job prospects. Mind you, it's only been like, 5 days. And I'm fucking terrified, it makes me want to curl up and die. I don't want to go out, eat. I'm on the brink of crying constantly, I have cried just walking down the street because I couldn't keep it in anymore. I am beyond miserable, I am hurting so much that I don't know how to contain the pain within myself anymore. And on top of this constant pain, every once in a while, I realize how desperately alone I am, and I get this sinking feeling of so much unhappiness that it feels like it's unmanageable anymore, and that the only way to make it stop immediately is to kill myself. There is no other solution to stop hurting right there and then, because it's so intense and for reasons beyond my immediate control. Does anyone else get that? That sudden feeling of panic and thinking \"I need to die now because this hurts too much to possibly bear\"? Btw, just so nobody gets concerned, I am not actually considering suicide, and I'm not planning on doing it, so please do not tell me to reach out to suicide hotline. But I can't stop obsessing about wanting death, because I am so terrified of this sinking depressing feeling. How can I stop feeling it? What can I possibly do to overcome it? To deal with it and make it hurt less? To be able to withstand it? I cannot go on like this, even though I don't really know what I mean by cannot since there is nothing I can do but go on... Hopefully someone knows what I mean.\n\nSorry for such a long text and for sounding so desperate, but you know what, I am exactly as desperate as I sound. I know I can't die from mental pain, but at the same time, I don't know it. It feels like I could die from how much it hurts.",

Its been hard without her and i get really sad about it because i know she loved me even if she didnt show it. Ive been hooked on drugs since i was 9. I started smoking pot and taking pills because i thought they would help. They did but it was temporarily. I still smoke every once in a wbile to try to help. I had this friend that was always there and we related on so many things. He killed himself with his fathers shotgun one night and i wasnt there to help. Its really been sticking with me and is always on my mind. The thought of death seems so scary but so inviting and i just want to feel the hands pull me into my eternal slumber. Its just very scary and i dont know what to do.",

            "selftext": "Hey guys. For the sake of privacy, I will change every persons name.\n\nMe - Me\nChloe - My exchange student\nT - My teacher\nCT - Chloes teacher\n\nAbout one year ago I took part in an exchange to Chicago, IL. I was elected, even though I have suffered from BPD for almost three years and every teacher knows. \nMy exchange student, Chloe, messaged me and we talked a lot to each other. Despite me being afraid of her not accepting me, I told her I was mentally ill and she was okay with it and told me she'd inform her parents. \n\nAs soon as I arrived in the states, every single American was waiting for their exchange student except for Chloe.\n\nSo I visited my exchange families home and met her entire family. They were super nice and glad to meet me. My first day was amazing and I enjoyed my time. The next day wasn't as good though since we went to the homecoming dance. I was very uncomfortable. I am used to hurting myself so I scratched my hand a little bit. \n\nDuring homecoming, Chloe left me completely on my own to leave with her date and get rid of me. So I was alone and felt ditched.\n\nThe next day we went bowling and she ditched me again, in a freaking mall. Chloe refused to talk to me during that time and I didn't really accept a few things she offered me because it felt off to me, like she had to buy me stuff even though she didn't like me. The next day she talked to my teacher, T, and her teacher, CT, about my behavior. She told them I severely hurt myself, was sad all the time etc.I got a grip and tried to be the best I could, even though it was hard. She felt sick and didn't even join me for TWO DAYS to talk to me or anything. On Thursday my classmates found it funny to bully me and embarass me in front of the entire school so I ran off crying. Chloe had to pick me up.\n\nChloe complained to T and CT again and I was threatened to get sent home. I felt so sorry. \nOn our last day she ditched me again, while I was talking to her and left me alone so I basically spent my last day there on my own. \n\nSoon after that I came out as trans and they were cool with it. \nI thought everything was fine and about a month later I get a message from her mother, that it was \"fate to meet me\", but also that they weren't informed about my mental illness, which seemed off to me as I told Chloe about it. \nHowever, it didn't keep me from messaging her mom and Chloe from time to time, asking them how they were. I messaged her mom more frequently since she said she didn't mind. Chloe got one or two messages a week in which I asked her how she was etc. \n\nOne week later I get a message by T, saying that Chloe and her mom felt harassed by me. This was shortly after I told Chloe I sent her the Christmas presents she asked me for. \n\nAbout 8 months later it was time for the Americans to visit us back. As Chloe saw me she broke down crying and told everyone how I \"severely scarred her\". And most people believed her. \n\nI still blame myself for what happened",

            "selftext": "So yes I'm extremely troubled. I have tried a lot of different things to improve my mental situation. I have tried exercising for over a year and it did nothing at all for me. I have tried taking supplements which I still take because they improve other things but they still don't help with my mental problems. I have tried picking up other hobbies, but I really cannot even describe how impossible it is for me to do anything productive. Every time I try to take up a hobby I get this extreme feeling of pain in my chest and these thoughts of \"you suck at everything, just commit suicide already\". It's the main reason why I don't do anything at all anymore it's because doing things hurts so much more than doing nothing. I am not in a good position to get therapy or drugs so like I mentioned in the beginning I'm very troubled and really don't know how much longer I'll be able to keep up living like this before I kill myself. Also I tried talking to other people and form friendships but no one ever cares enough about me to actually talk to me on their own accord I always have to talk to them and they always seem to be annoyed by it. And don't even let me get started on relationships. I don't even try anymore. I habe hd these very impairing symptoms for over 3 years now and it only seems to be getting worse since I've also developed some kind of derealization which makes me very scared of losing my mind. I'm constantly in a state of fear. Also I'm sorry to anyone who bothered to read this that I suck at writing as well. If you have made it this far I really appreciate that you have taken up your time to do so.",

            "selftext": "First time posting,\n\nI would love to hear any advice you may have to approach this sensitive topic.\n\nMy boyfriend and I (gay couple) have been together for a little more than a year, and things have been pretty steady. It\u2019s never been the most amazing time and has at times been horrible. We are both in our 20\u2019s but I\u2019m three years older than him and  I feel protective over him. I love him so much and I would hate to hurt him, but I feel like in this relationship I have lost the sense of who I am, and I make excuses for his behaviour.\n\nHe has had a hard life, his dad died when he was 14 in a natural disaster, his sister was addicted to hard drugs, and he has been sexually molested in more than one occasion. He has been on antidepressants for a long time and has tried therapy but says it doesn\u2019t help. I have tried to get him to go back to therapy, but he hasn\u2019t. I know he wants help and says he feel hopeless, and I really don\u2019t know how to help. I feel like I\u2019m at a loss. He often makes suicide jokes, and I am scared that one day I\u2019ll come home to him having committed suicide.\n\nHe says he doesn\u2019t feel a connection with anything, and because of that he doesn\u2019t know if he feels a connection to me. It\u2019s hard to live with someone who looks at you but doesn\u2019t see you. He lives in a different city from his mum, who is his best friend. His circle is very small and to a point I feel like I\u2019m everyone he has. One or two close friends, and the rest are more of acquaintances. He doesn\u2019t do small talk so it\u2019s hard for him to create relationship with others. \n\nI guess I just want to know how to help him while still looking after myself. I don\u2019t even know if I can continue doing this as I feel like it\u2019s taking a toll on me. Feeling selfish.\n\nThanks for reading x",

I want to dedicate a part of my lessons next week to raise awareness about mental health issues that people are now facing and maybe provide some basic tips and pieces of advice. \nSo I decided to come here and ask for help or any ideas that can help me plan this part of my lesson. \nAnything I should mention or talk about specifically? \nIf you're a teacher and have done this before could you please share some ideas or resources that can be useful? \n\nThank you all so much in advance.",

            "selftext": "My parents are constantly fighting, my mom will come into my room and tell me all of the awful things my does do to her (forces her to have sex, threatens her with knives in the middle of the night, smashes her phone) lately he\u2019s been drinking on top of acting completely erratic. My boyfriend who was really the only person i had on my life that was keeping me from being completely depressed has told me he doesn\u2019t love me anymore and texts me every night telling me he\u2019s getting drunk and doing things to hurt me. Both of my sisters have moved out of the house so i\u2019m the only one left to have to deal with things like this. I feel completely alone. I don\u2019t go to school, I dropped out of high school thanks to my parents talking me into it because it was more convenient for them, Not completely blaming them but it seems like every time i try to study for my Hiset exam my mom comes into my room crying and complaining about my dad and i don\u2019t tell her to leave because she has no where to go. I\u2019m completely alone, the only people i have contact with are completely miserable and don\u2019t care about how i\u2019m feeling or doing. They don\u2019t care about my future at all. I feel like i\u2019m suffocating on life and im getting to where i can\u2019t take it anymore. I\u2019ve been picking up awful and unhealthy habits that i\u2019ve never had or done before. I\u2019m feeling like i\u2019m just falling down a deep hole and there\u2019s no way out. Thank you to anyone who reads this.",

But if I am alone, if something bad happens, if I fail at something all these thoughts come back. That I am worthless, and impossible to correct freak of nature. That I will never have good life and happy future is not an option for me. Because I am me, I was born with this set of cards that I have to use to play the game of life.\nAnd it makes me wonder, being this whiny ass bitch. Why I am such a pathetic piece of worthless oxygen consumptor. Why can\u2019t I change. Maybe all this whining crying and long faces are just my way of getting the attention and love.. That other people get by making others happy. By loving. By sharing good stories and good times. By singing and laughing together.\nAnd the fact that I understand this and keep repeating my mistakes makes me ever more pathetic. Filthy. Just not worth. I know I am guilty and I agree with all of that. But I am still feeling how it hurts. \nI once read this quote that sums up all of my life: too much of a coward to live, too much of a coward to kill myself. I\u2019m just stuck in this fucking limbo of guilt, self hate, not doing anything about it and then feeling even more guilt and self hate. \nPathetic. \nI just hope there is no afterlife and I don\u2019t abuse the resources of this earth and of other human beings for too long.\nIt hurts to be a mistake, to understand it and to be not strong enough, smart enough, just enough to change it.\nI dont know why Im posting it here. I wish there was an explanation, a reason behind all of this, something that was not only my fault. But I know it isnt. It\u2019s just me and my shit. No excuses, no explanations. I should stop this bullshit self pity circus.",

            "selftext": "I'am an 18 year old male, currently in college, struggling with depression. I am not in a good situation, and just feel so bad about it.\nI am just a low brained guy, who wasn't much good at academics, no matter how hard i tried. Coming from a sort of poor family(not that poor, but lower in middle class). About 7 months ago, i had given a lot of college entrance exams, and had tried my best, but had failed to get proper results. Somehow, got into a superb college. That college is insanely costly , and my father dosen't even earn that amount of money in a year which is required for fees of two semesters( bout an year). Since i had got bad marks in the entrance exam, so i had to take a dual degree( through it, if your grades were high enough at the end of year 1, then you could get the second subject of your choice). So, now, my dad enrolled me in this college( i honestly wanted to go to some cheap ass college). But, there's a scholarship thing here ,which is given to high graders. I went into this college hoping to get that. Mid sem exams just finished, i am getting super bad grades, inspire of trying very hard. I probably won't be getting a proper second subject, and neither the scholarship. I know there's education loan available, but i doubt i would be able to earn much to be able to pay it later properly, as i would probably get a super shitty subject.\n\nI am feeling really bad right now about it. I am just wasting my dad's money. My parents sacrificed a lot to get me a proper education, but I just failed their expectations. I know this post seems childish and foolish, but i am already struggling from depression and so am feeling really bad about it. I am just a fucking pussy who wants to see his parents live comfortably, not in a poor condition.",

Recently I began attending another school that is very far away (90 minute commute, and evening so I can't go out too late) and I have thoughts of quitting. I arrive at midnight! And leave by 2pm. It's very anxiety-inducing because it's expensive to commute. I skipped class today because I had a bit of a cold but mostly because I'm feeling like shit already. Really stressing, our teachers want us to skip our 20min break so -sometimes- we can leave a bit earlier too, which didn't happen yet. It's just... Too much for me. I'm filled with sorrow and I don't know how to take this. \n\nI feel like everything I do is for nothing. I don't have any real friend (only some people from overseas in a Discord server that I text), I have no hobbies other than I guess gaming, I live in the middle of nowhere (have to take a bus to go anywhere), and I just feel so empty because no matter how much effort I put into something, there's nothing good for me in the end. My father who I live with has a job, works hard and all sure, but then he's taking over a week off next month and visiting some other country. When I worked this summer, he had my savings taken from me, so I'm left with nothing, and no money to go on a trip or buy anything. I was planning on buying a console to play with these foreign friends but I guess not. So yeah, I feel like there's nothing I can enjoy, so there's no meaning to all this.\n\nI'm so torn right now. I don't want to quit. Because there's nothing else for me. No job, nothing else to study and prepare for. But on the other hand, I'm miserable!!!!!! I'm desperate for a solution to this.",

            "selftext": "For a background, we\u2019ve been together almost 2 years.  She was drinking heavily and on celexa when I met her and slowly started drinking less because I was so concerned.  Last summer she ran out of celexa and forgot to visit her doctor and decided to go off of it after 4 years of being on it.  Fast forward to right now, she\u2019s been drinking one day or less per week, which is less than she was even 3 months ago.  The only thing that makes me think her situation can be helped without it is that she is in a job she doesn\u2019t like, and hasn\u2019t found a career she likes and has been out of college for almost 12 years.  She also was mentally and physically abused by an alcoholic mother and has recently gone back to therapy to try and put the pieces together and heal.  I love her but I am worried that she\u2019s only going to find temporary relief from this.  I was briefly medicated with SSRl\u2019s in high school and couldn\u2019t stand the side effects.  I\u2019ve resorted to finding other ways to self medicate and exercise and do things to stay above water.  She always reminds me that I\u2019m not like her and we are way different but I see so many similarities in us that it\u2019s hard to sit back and watch and feel helpless.  We are both around 35 and next year we are tying the knot.  We both also want children and know time is ticking.  It\u2019s also on my mind that she will need to stop taking this if she gets pregnant.  We also still see her mom fairly often since she lives nearby and is very adamant about being a part of our lives even though it\u2019s hard for my fianc\u00e9.  We have talked about moving back to the east coast where I am from and leaving all of this behind, the memories, her mother, the town she grew up in but she wants to wait till after the wedding which is going to be in our current town.  I think moving out of town sooner, getting her back to the gym more, and helping her find a new career or maybe go back to school is enough to help her.  \nHer depression isn\u2019t suicidal or severe but more of a moodiness that never goes away, sleeping 10 hours a day and being frustrated and irritated a lot.  I take on most of the responsibilities in the place we rent, pay almost all of the bills and let her use my car for work since I work from home.  So I\u2019ve made it easier for her to deal with her problems and have tried so hard to help.  One last thing is that her mother is borderline and was also abused and my fianc\u00e9 seems to really show signs of borderline personality disorder.  She\u2019s done DBT with past therapists but never formally diagnosed as far as I know.  \nAnyway this turned into a rant but really I want to know is how can I convince her that it\u2019s not depression and maybe BPD or maybe taking the meds is what needs to happen now for a period of time?",

But if I am alone, if something bad happens, if I fail at something all these thoughts come back. That I am worthless, and impossible to correct freak of nature. That I will never have good life and happy future is not an option for me. Because I am me, I was born with this set of cards that I have to use to play the game of life.\nAnd it makes me wonder, being this whiny ass bitch. Why I am such a pathetic piece of worthless oxygen consumptor. Why can\u2019t I change. Maybe all this whining crying and long faces are just my way of getting the attention and love.. That other people get by making others happy. By loving. By sharing good stories and good times. By singing and laughing together.\nAnd the fact that I understand this and keep repeating my mistakes makes me ever more pathetic. Filthy. Just not worth. I know I am guilty and I agree with all of that. But I am still feeling how it hurts. \nI once read this quote that sums up all of my life: too much of a coward to live, too much of a coward to kill myself. I\u2019m just stuck in this fucking limbo of guilt, self hate, not doing anything about it and then feeling even more guilt and self hate. \nPathetic. \nI just hope there is no afterlife and I don\u2019t abuse the resources of this earth and of other human beings for too long.\nIt hurts to be a mistake, to understand it and to be not strong enough, smart enough, just enough to change it.",

Do girls and women think we can just turn off our sexual frustrations and talk about nothing? How can I care about finding a hobby when in the back of my head I know I'm just doing it to have something to pretend to give a shit about thats not sex,\n\nDo they not realize how deeply ingrained this need is in us? And yet the deeper we need it the more repulsed they get? \nAnd some of us hate fakeness so the thought of being a fake \"me\" to get into someone pants sickens me...but I can't be the real me because for some reason its disgusting and unattractive I have this desire for physical intimacy....\n\nMy depression sometimes turns into anger and frustration and I'm sorry for the rant but this is one of those times.",

Mainly just posting here because after making [this post](https://old.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/dbvdxf/i_dont_drink_regularly_but_whenever_i_start_i_can/) I've already broken my promise again. Oh well, I don't really care, although in some vague way I want help. I think at least, because whenever I'm drunk I become extremely attention-seeking online.\n\nThe problem is, I'm literally too stable to seriously seek help. If I went to seek out a therapist, then in my country I'd be placed on a waiting list where waiting times are literally at least 6 to 8 months, if I went to the hospital to admit myself it would literally be based on lies, as I'm not in an active crisis where I feel I have no control over myself. I genuinely would like to admit myself, but in truth it's not because I'm scared of myself or because I want to feel better, but mainly just because I'd like to get out of having to go to work. \n\nIn the end, my situation is this: I often post online about issues that resemble depression, but I feel utterly separate from what I'm writing. It's like another person wrote what I wrote and so I always end up finding some justification or some lie that I tell myself, with which I prevent myself from seeking out help. \n\nOr this: Two nights ago I got so drunk alone in my room that I ended up waking up just drenched in my own vomit. I just simply changed into new clothes and went to work like nothing happened, and cleaned up the mess once I got home. It genuinely didn't shock me and in some ways it feels like this never happened. \n\nI'd love to be overwhelmed by my emotions and finally break down so much that I'll find help, but it will never happen. I'll just keep seeking attention online. But if it's any solace to you, the one thing I genuinely feel is that I utterly despise myself. I fucking hate myself. \n\nHonestly, I just really want somebody who is understanding of these kinds of issues to talk to me. Preferably in real life too, but seeking out help is so fucking hard. In some ways I genuinely am afraid of myself and desperately want help, but I feel completely separate from myself...",

            "selftext": "I haven't been real with anyone in my lifetime. Please forgive me for unloading but everyday I feel myself slip deeper.\n\nI can't stomach myself anymore. I've hurt people in my life, often to push them away from me and sometimes because I feel I deserve a life of shame.\n\nAll my friends I had hate me. Deliberately I set out to punish myself because I've always felt like a monster. Undeserving of love. Yet still I have someone who cares for me and I don't know why.\n\nI spend my days wishing for death but I'm too afraid to die. I don't believe in god but I fear damnation.If I knew for definite paradise lay beyond, I wouldn't hesitate to  kill myself.\n\nThe world seems so oblivious to the suffering that we dwell in. People are so fake, like actors crafting an image they want us to see. I'm so tired of the manipualtiveness of humanity. Everyday I have to dwell in this world is another I wish for death.\n\nI can't escape my past. My past is like chains, binding me to the corpse of my former self. I look back and wonder why I was. I'd blame my upbringing if I didn't despise excuses.\n\nMy existence is on the fringe. Too anxious to be bold. Too bold to be ignored. The paradox hurts my brain every single day.\n\nI hate myself more than I hate the horrible world we have crafted. The beauty in the world isn't enough to snap me from this casket.\n\nI'm sorry if this seems like rambling. It's hard to put my feelings into words but I hope someone at least understands. Don't know how long I have left living this life.",

There is a severe lack of motivation to do even the smallest of every day things. \n\nI started taking 10mg of the generic version of Lexapro almost a year ago. The beginning was rough, but eventually my body acclimated and I no longer had those really intense, deep dips into depression that I would occasionally have. I still had bouts of moodiness, but the medication seemed to take the edge off. However, I gained 35 pounds and could not lose the weight no matter what. \n\nI talked to my doctor at the end of August and she suggested lowering my dosage of Lexapro to 5mg and adding 150mg of Wellbutrin and 10mg of Buspirone HCL for the daily anxiety. I take all three at the same time in the morning. My doctor is great and is very open to helping me find a medication plan that works for me. \n\nAfter a month, I have noticed a dramatic shift, but not for the better. I am so lethargic and it is mentally taxing to even *think* about doing anything. I\u2019m more irritable and I haven\u2019t noticed a decrease in my appetite yet. \n\nThose of you who have been on either medication, what were your experiences? I know everyone reacts differently, but I can\u2019t tell if I should increase my Wellbutrin dosage or increase both or what. I definitely don\u2019t want to feel like this anymore. Should I give it more time? My doctor is open to whatever option I want to take, I just can\u2019t decide which way to go with it.",

For example I like to collect the Marvel superhero movies on blu Ray, I sit those on a book shelf in one side of my room.\n\nI often buy those in a spur of them moment. I'll be completely honest, I have yet to even take the plastic wrapping off some of the movie cases since I usually feel too depressed to watch a movie and find it hard to sit down for a solid 2 hours. Or else I feel even more lazy than I always do. But when I'm out at the store looking for the latest addition to my collection I feel a little happy. But then I feel guilty since it feels like I should have saved that money for something important, even though that important thing wouldn't have made me happy at all.\n\nDoes anyone else experience this?",

Theres this girl who is my only friend and really the only other person I talk to...she wants to be in a relationship with me but it's been years and I just can't see myself being happy with her for life...she's literally the only person other than my family I talk with on a regular basis, and I hate myself inside for thinking this but I also don't find her physically attractive so everytime she mentions doing anything physical I actually in my head think \"no way\", and to be honest I don't think I could even have sex with her because shes become like a sister and I really don't think I could actually ever get aroused.\n\nI see posts about people who haven't even held a girls hand and I feel ashamed of myself that I have this girl here, wanting to be with me, but something inside me is like pushing her away...it's like the more she expresses her love and care the more I resent her for some reason....shes there waiting for me to say \"Im ready to start dating\" but I still feel alone...always, even when we're hanging out. Its like the second I can actually have something my mind makes me feel like I don't want it, and my desire for the things I can never have increase..like chasing an imaginary carrot but once you catch it you automatically don't want it, simply because of the fact you can have it. \n\nI never tell her these things, and I just tell her I'm not interested in sex with anyone atm to spare her feelings, but then I find myself watching porn to relieve the sexual frustration..and its a huge cycle of shame and guilt...am I just spoiled with her?\n\nI need some outside opinions guys please",

I recently got cut from my soccer team i\u2019ve been on for years and it really hit me hard to be honest. Maybe I\u2019m just not meant to do any of these things and i\u2019m as good as i\u2019ll ever get which isn\u2019t enough to be pro. For example i play piano but i\u2019m not good enough to grab a lot of people\u2019s attentions, I like soccer but i keep getting cut, I like basketball and hockey but i\u2019m not good enough to even try out for a team, and I\u2019m really good at video games but nowhere near good enough to make it pro, even in my shop classes i\u2019m one of the best students but there\u2019s always kids that are better than me that the teacher calls on first. I just need someone to give me advice on what to do here, am I just physically incapable of getting better at anything or is it all in my head?",

I spent the last 11 years of my life doing drugs and was homeless a good portion of it. I just got clean back in May and I do feel like it's fair for me to want to die, when I got clean I had absolutely nothing, I had nobody, I was fucking miserable. Now that I've gotten clean almost everyone in my life thinks I'm still the same fucking heroin junkie and I'm gonna go out and shoot some heroin at any given moment. Like I've changed but like I wish everyone wouldn't doubt me and still treat me like the piece of shit I was. As of today I'm on bed rest from an episode of one of my health problems and it's like I'm screaming but no sound is coming out. I just want to disappear forever but god forbid if I say that I have to go to the fucking hospital. I have every fucking right to want to die, I'm still trying to figure out who I am, I've lost so many people I love this year, I have no money, everyone doubts me. I'm fucking miserable and I have no clue who I am but all I know is I want to die.",

Unfortunately it seems to get harder everyday and trying to find like minded individualist while being introverted, anxious, worried, and bad with people makes it hard to meet people and keep them around. Not to mention I need to get over somethings from my past to really leap forward and improve.\n\nI also noticed that self doubt is a big issue and that all the things that society makes us deal with and makes us be apart of seems fake and kind of dumb. I used to think that the system was stupid which I still do but I realize I just have to do the work to get better and to move ahead and higher. Its just that sometimes I feel its so fake and stupid that there isn't any point to it when I just need to do it and stop bitching so much. \n\nThanks",

The growing popularity of dating apps and hook-up culture also leads to a growing emphasis on looks first and foremost. Ugly people are left behind and no one cares about them anymore. Politically the left and the right get more and more ridiculous every day. Politics are such a joke at this point. The whole world is a fucking joke. There is still so much more I could talk about.

Then straight after was lunch. At lunch I ran into one of my friends and he asked if I was alright. I replied no in a jokey way even though I seriously wasn't (at this point I was just waiting for my 'friends' to sign out of school). Then he asked why and I just gave generic answers and when he seriously pressed me I said if he said anything else I was going to cry and then ran away but told my 'friends' to wait for me to go to the toilet and I'd be two minutes. When I had composed myself in the toilets and came out I looked for my 'friends' and they were gone. They just left without me.

Like my life has no purpose and that nothing matters and I can't leave the bed and my tears are getting watery and I don't know why and I can't share this with anyone because I have such a difficulty sharing hard moments with people because it feels like they think I'm only doing it for the attention and also, I don't want to seem weak.

I broke a glass, yet again, and just broke down when I took a bath immediately after, because even my fianc\u00e9 commented, \"Jesus, how many glasses do you want to break?\"\n\nI honestly don't know what to do about it. It happens like there would be a glass in front of me, and I would be talking and moving my hands, and there my fucked up hand goes knocking over the glass, which then falls to the ground and shatters into pieces. I've tried to be careful, but it happens when I don't even expect it to. Like tonight, I poured some soda for my niece into a glass and gave it to her. She drinks it and puts it on the table close to the sink. Later on she asks me a question, I go closer to hear what she's telling me and BAM, my body somehow knocked the glass over. \n\nI'm in bed right now crying, because I'm such a big fuck up. And my fianc\u00e9 notices, but I can tell he's not in the mood for my bullshit, so he's in the living room watching tv. I'm going to be honest; I know my fianc\u00e9 doesn't understand depression, because I've tried explaining it, but he just doesn't get it. Why can't I be normal? Why can't I stop fucking up the whole time? \n\nWhat the hell is wrong with me?",

            "selftext": "when it comes down to it, life is meaningless. there is overall no point to it. we are put into the world just to get thrown into school from the time we are age 4. we then typically go to school for the next 13 or so years. just to be told that we need to go to college to get a higher education so we can be successful, which is true in the day in age bc it\u2019s a struggle to get a good paying job w out a degree. so we go to school for another 2-8 years (sometimes more). we then go on to get jobs after college, but most adults from what i\u2019ve observed are not even doing careers they have degrees for. they also half of the time, don\u2019t even enjoy what they\u2019re doing. then you go on to work everyday for the rest of your life until get old and can\u2019t take care of yourself, and then die. But in between this time, some have children and go and put them through the same pointless process that will ultimately end in their demise. so the question is what is the point? what\u2019s the point of going to school, if i\u2019m just going to have to work until i die. because in society, if you don\u2019t have money chances are you won\u2019t be happy. i know they say that money isn\u2019t everything, but it\u2019s a lie. money is everything. you need money for food, houses, to get a higher education (that is practically forced upon us), to do things that you enjoy. for me personally i want to travel, see new places. i can\u2019t do that without money. i can\u2019t get money without a job. i can\u2019t get a well enough paying job to be able to travel, without having education after high school. i can\u2019t go to college without money, which just loops back around to the start of the problem. so then you have to get student loans, which a lot of adults still pay to this day. i can\u2019t use my money to do what i want if i have to pay expensive student loans. it\u2019s even worse for those who are born into poverty or are not as fortunate as others. from the moment they are born, all odds are against them. from time to time those people make it out of that situation but what about those who don\u2019t. so they become the ones that have to work everyday for the rest of their lives until they die. and don\u2019t even get me started on the school system in the US. That is truly the root of many mental illnesses within the younger generations and it\u2019s a problem. i guess what i\u2019m trying to say is: i\u2019m not a fan of school, but i have to do it. i\u2019m not passionate about anything so i have no idea what type of career i want, i just want to live freely and have fun. but i don\u2019t have the funds to be able to do that. so chances are i\u2019ll be stuck working a typical 9-5 job that makes me hate my life, but i have to do it just to survive. so what is the point in going through all of that. what\u2019s the point of putting in all of that effort, time, money, into something that won\u2019t make me happy. what is the purpose of this pointless cycle that is existence?",

These states feel like a mixture of childhood memories, thoughts of time and space, visions of grand landscapes all formed together into one big emotion.\n\nThey are just so pure and potent. Like I have this thing going in my head and it just grabs and puts me on a top of a mountain peak. I just stand there and there is nothing I can to do except being in complete awe. Complete bliss and mystery.\n\nI get these states randomly, especially when I'm on my own. They feel like a totally different universe inside my head. \n\nIt feels like being alone in the woods somewhere, where there are no other people around. But it's just so peaceful. Usually, they even feel bigger that the reality that I live in.\n\nI just don't understand why people don't really talk about these emotions or states (granted they do experience them).\n\nI would guess that people always tend to associate them with 'reality', reminiscing about how they saw this beautiful girl and fell in love or listened to a led zeppelin's starway to heaven for the first time. But I've never heard anyone talking about these states of just being transported into a totally different realm withough any outside stimuli.\n\nAm I the only one having these? Does anybody get what I'm talking about?",

Signed up to 8 societies in the hopes I'd get to make new friends, 6 are inactive, 1 requires an audition (which I'll  probably fail since my last guitar just broke) and I haven't been able to attend a single meeting for the last one because my family keeps barging in with pre-made plans. Years of suffering, hurt, pain, suicidal thoughts and struggle all for a promise that it gets better. It doesn't, I'm more alone then ever. It never gets better no matter what I do, I just want to be happy and have friends or at least something to even care about, but life obviously has other plans for me.

            "selftext": "So, hi Redditors, I'm Kiuchi and I want to tell you what's been bothering me for quite a long while now. I can't tell this to anyone in the real world because I don't really have anybody to tell this to.  \nI'm sorry if my English is bad, but it's not my main language.  \nAs a kid, I never understood people who were sad for longer than like 3 days maybe. Life was sooo worth living and at the age of 8 I actually wondered why I would die one day - life was fun back then wasn't it?  \n\n\nThen 6th grade came. In the second semester of the school year which is basically the second half of it, I had to change schools. I did something really stupid in the Internet. I don't want to share the details really, but I honestly can't believe that if it hadn't been for it, I would probably live a normal happy life. The vision of nothing what's happening now actually happening is so overwhelming I'm crying now.  \n\n\nSo I changed schools. Because thanks to the incident my reputation was, well, destroyed. I mean, I still had my friends who were pretty supportive, but my parents insisted on changing schools. So in 7th grade when I was 13, I found myself at a new school, surrounded by new people. I wasn't very sociable, so you can tell I wasn't the one to meet those new guys. They didn't come to me either. And we weren't talking. At all.  \n\n\nI was still trying to process the fact that I just lost touch with most people from my school. Previous school. They started bullying me. First emotionally, then it all started for real. They started closing me in empty rooms, not letting me out. Teachers were blind and deaf. I would cry and they wouldn't let me out anyway. They were just laughing at me. Also, they were saying I would end up poor and uncool if I didn't talk to people, that they didn't know why people like me existed because that's just a waste of space, I wouldn't be remembered by anyone anyway, so why not speed up death and kill myself, that they couldn't believe nerds were this autistic. Well, they said many more things. But I was yet, very strong mentally and put up with this.\n\nThough I was NOT depressed yet back then. I made my own, fictional universe, where I could travel anywhere. I could imagine myself being just somewhere else, not in this world. I even made 'books' (stories written in my paper notebooks) about adventures in my universe. Surprisingly, I wasn't a hero then. I imagined myself differently, that I was a different person. Not my real self.\n\nI didn't want to tell my parents about the bullying but they found out somehow. And I found myself in a different school again at the beginning of the 8th year ( we have 8 years primary school). I was scared. That's when I started having symptoms of social anxiety. Bullying was a really traumatic experience to me but I never showed or felt it so much at first. The new class were actually really friendly and the ones to come up to me and offer me a helping hand. The worst part was when they were acting why I switched schools. But I made it somehow. Made friends with lots of people.\n\nHalf a year had passed and I was nearly over the past, but the teachers started it all back again. We were preparing for the 8th class exam, the only one you have in primary school, so it was our first school exam ever. The teachers were actually bullying me, telling me I was useless, that others had straight A's and I was the only one to stay behind it all. But they weren't telling this only to me. They had the same dirty talk to all the people in my class. I just felt the teachers were so much more about me than anybody else. Friends supported me much saying that it will all be fine, but after a while it stopped working. The teachers were mocking me more and more.\n\n  \nThe exam came and I was the best in the class. 100 % in English, 83% in Math, 88% in my native language. At the end of year ceremony I told my teachers that them bullying me like that should've never happened and they just said I should be grateful they motivated me. Really, the fuck???\n\nDuring my vacation I was on a military summer camp. Everything was fine until I came back. I had to leave all those people, wonderful actually, people behind. I realized it was like this ALL THE TIME. I met new people, I left them. Met them, left them. \n\nNow the modern times. A month ago the time has come to go to high school. In my case it was a Technical High School (ICT profile). Because in my country you get like 8 years primary, 4 years of normal high school (u have to go to college), 5 years of technical high school (you get job qualies but you can go to college then). I got those flashbacks of 7th grade again. My anxiety got worse, and I got a panic attack during classes. My newest class didn't really think anything bad of it they even looked a bit worried.\n\nThough because of the trauma, I won't ever be able to go to them and talk, so I sit alone. I just met one friend here and we talk together all the time. He's normally quiet like me, but we have a lot to talk about. I don't think I know him enough to tell him any of my secrets yet.\n\nAnyway my real depression is about growing up. As I look back, I see how happy I was as a child before I did that shit in the Internet. How I smiled. From a positive, vibrant person, I changed into an anxious wreck of a person. I just hate myself for who I am, for what I did. Tried to cut my veins, but I didn't cut deep enough and now I have to pay attention to my sleeves all the time. Self harming on thighs.\n\nAlso, nothing in life makes me happy, I am SICK of pretending I am alright, laughing at school. I lost interest in everything, all I want to do is I wanna sit in front of the screen, eat a lot and go to sleep. I'm thinking about the reaction of others if I committed suicide. I think I really am a waste of space sometimes.\n\nI can't go to a therapist because I would have to tell my parents. I don't want to, though. They aren't really supportive, all my life they've been emotionally abusive just like the bullies. I nearly died during birth. And they're saying things like 'you should have died back then, all the problems you make would never happen'.\n\nMaybe if my closest ones are saying this then it is the truth. I don't know what to think of it.\n\nGuys what do I do? I feel like I'm on the verge of actually trying again, but I also feel like something's driving me to do that, and it isn't really me.",

I am very hands-on kinda guy. I hate books but can study for hours and hours if its hand-on.\n Anyways. I have a lot of pressure. I am eldest one in my home and the whole future of my family relies on me. On August 20th August 2019 my results came And I had been detained. I was broken. This means i have sit down for a whole year. And continue without my friends for the rest of program. I can't go for masters because I won't be considered because I was detained.\ni didn't tell it to my mom. Or my sister. Or my dad. I then applied for re-evaluation of my papers. Secretly. And Today my results came in. And I passed! I was crying with happiness. I had been struggling for the last 43 days looking at my mom lying.\n Today I cried and I told her everything she told she would've supported. Anyways just wanna say anything is possible if it needs to happen.\nI want to thank My God, My family, and most importantly my friends from Reddit and real life.

Of all the horrible things I've done, there's just one that not even god could forgive. And I'm just so tired of feeling guilty. Every second of every day for years now. I give in sometimes and drink myself straight to the hospital.  And people say \"just forgive yourself\" \"you need to learn forgiveness\" blah blah blah. Imagine the worst thing you could do. The absolute worst. What I've done makes that act look like petty theft. And it's not really \"no one can forgive me for this\" it's how the hell can I ever forgive myself? I can't. I just want to erase my memory. \n\nAdd this guilt to over ten years of depression, parents forcing you into improper treatment, in and out of institutions, inability to find a job, unsupportive and distant while she just sits there on her phone every single second she's not asleep, drugs, alcohol, depression being misdiagnosed, no friends... I try to find a silver lining. I try to find a way through it, but this one day at a time crap isn't helping. In fact, it just keeps eating away at my soul and there's barely anything left. I don't even have the energy to play with my son anymore and he's the only thing keeping me here. \n\nI used to write... alot, actually. I have several books that exceed 140k words. Now, I can't even come up with anything to even write about. I try and I try and I try and it's never enough. I've been desperate for far too long and I just need some fucking help getting out of this. I can't sleep. I can't think. I can't even drive to the store without thinking of driving my car off the mountain. I have to get better for my son, but I just can't figure out how.. been years with no progress whatsoever. I can't live with what I've done and I can'r escape this lack of feeling... this bottomless pit. Just stuck in an eternal void.",

I didn't know anyone in this new city besides one person and assumed since I was transferring with work and that I had an apartment, everything was going to be good (boy was I wrong!).\n\nAs soon as I moved, I started getting weird physical symptoms (body aches, muscle pain, headaches, fatigue) and I became a huge recluse spending all my time out of work in my apartment binge drinking. Said person I knew in this city isn't my friend anymore, my other friends here are over me and I am financially struggling. Now, I'm sitting in my apartment drinking some more and got wasted last night and passed out without recollection of what happened. Any tips on how I can overcome this or cope? I recently started therapy and don't know much about medications.",

I didn't r\u00e9alise it back then but this was the first time I felt anything for something that wasn't my obsessive love interest.\n\nFast forward a few months and here I am in four different th\u00e9\u00e2tre projects (want more) and about to study that shit at Uni.\n\nYesterday something happened, my th\u00e9\u00e2tre schedules overlap with each other (two of them are at the same school) so I went to my th\u00e9\u00e2tre teacher (happens to be the go to guy for any kind of problems as well), I knocked, was let in, saw his kind face and... Completely forgot why I was there\n\nI had visions of the world ending the night prior + a month of deepening depression\n\nCompletely lost I decided to just be open to the guy. He's one of the men who look like Santa, white hair and beard and an unexplainably friendly face. I had no idea what was going to happen.\n\nTurns out he was depressed as well and we had a nice conversation about depression :)\n\nAs much as I liked that, seeing someone in the possision I aspire to be in experiencing the same things I do deeply unsettled me",

Everything I see becomes nothingness.\n\nI just finished watching TV series Hannibal. I've never seen anything as perfect in televison as Hannibal.  I can only imagine how it feels like to watch perfect TV serie while having emotions, using your intellect to connect the dots, being part of something as perfect as Hannibal while feeling like humanbeing. I can say it, it was perfect, so you may think, I must have felt something when I use the word like this (\"perfect\") so I must have 'experienced' it like this. But I didn't. I half-experienced it.  I never am feeling anything. I can only witness it while not being connected. It's the most difficult thing to describe. It's just hell. So I don't feel exactly 'pain' or even 'sadness', but I feel I am aware that I'm missing out on human experience even if 'beauty' is delievered  to me like this show was, because I don't have the tools inside me to be a human.\n\nYou may say it's just a TV show, but it applies to everywhere in my life, every day, seemingly forever. I know that my father is a great man, but I don't feel it. I feel nothing. I don't feel anything when I'm doing something, just silent horror of emptiness that continues and continues every day. And when people say \"it gets better, nothing stays the same\" then I've had this problem since I was a kid. I'm not a sociopath, I don't want to hurt anyone, manipulate with anyone, and I don't. But I have nothing to do with other humanbeings without having feelings, emotions.  I have no reason to be \"alive\" while being empty, because everything becomes nothingness inside me. I have nothing to do in life while even most gorgeous places on Earth won't make me feel a normal feeling. Every day at some point, at some hour, for years, I hear my inner-monologue saying: I can't do this anymore, not like this, having a life while not being alive, for years, and people have confidence to say it gets better, I'd like to see that person who says that to live inside me even one day while feeling the emptiness of 27 years of this hell on his shoulders and then understand there isn't nothing that can be better. That 'It' that's supposed to get better is everything I am, but my inner being is just... hollow.",

I was a good student, won scholarships but couldn\u2019t even travel until I started working after graduation. I still live with my parents which is quote common in my country. These days I feel extremely suffocated. My mom is not an easy person, she has sudden outbursts, ups and downs which she regrets later but inflicts too much damage. I feel like my family, the fact that I always considered my future bearing them in my mind kept me from realizing my true potential. Don\u2019t get me wrong I am happy that I can help out even if it is only a little. But things just piled up (dissatisfied with work, no SO to lean on etc.) I just catch myself wishing that living is too hard and if I were to suddenly die (of course without pain somehow) those who make me feel stressed and angry would regret in the wake of it. So partly selfish and partly depressed but this is the thought coming to my mind once in a while. I just hope that my stress levels get down to zero soon.",

It\u2019s so embarrassing and shameful and it\u2019s like a vicious cycle. I don\u2019t want to live in filth anymore. I can\u2019t even handle looking at the messes I make without breaking down. I can\u2019t handle the guilt long enough to fucking pick things off the ground and put them in trash bags. I feel so much shame even taking out the trash, knowing that I will run into my neighbors. They will know somehow. They will see my greasy unbrushed hair just know that I can\u2019t even function like a normal human being. They will hear me taking out bags and bags of trash and wonder what is going on. If anyone knew how bad things have gotten they would be so shocked. I\u2019ve literally developed a fear of going into my kitchen because of how messy it is, so I hardly even eat anything, which only makes everything worse. I haven\u2019t opened my fridge in a month. I don\u2019t understand why I just can\u2019t fucking focus and do it. I\u2019ve spent so much time feeling anxious and stressed about cleaning that I could have already cleaned my place top to bottom 10 times over. I recognize how ridiculous I am but feel powerless to do anything. I\u2019ve had professional cleaning appointments scheduled and cancel the day of because I  panic knowing people are going to come in my home and see how I live. Even \u201ccleaning for the cleaning lady\u201d was too fucking hard for me. Looking for any words of encouragement. Any advice. The shame eats me alive and makes me feel frozen and incapable of anything. I\u2019ve been on the verge of a breakdown all day, knowing it\u2019s only getting worse and worse. I just want a clean living space so maybe my head will be a little bit clearer. It literally feels like the reflection of my rotting brain. It feels impossible. In the time I\u2019ve written this I probably could have already done so much!!!! I\u2019ve never been so low. I promise that for every comment on this post I will fill and take out one bag of trash. It sounds so stupid but please help motivate me :(",

However my GP wanted to see how I'd get on with certain meds first and keep an eye on my mood. \n\nIm really struggling now though, my problems keep piling up and Ive started to self harm again.

            "selftext": "Its been a looong dark and scary 6 months going through this court process, and I was really hoping it was going to end on a positive note, but the presentence report has recommended to the judge that I serve 90 days in jail, and I am distraught with anxiety and depression right now.. I really can't stop thinking of suicide even more now.\n\nWhen all this went down, I was on a long slow downspiral. I became so depressed that I couldn't hold jobs, and was in my 4th year at college living away from home, so much of it was easily masked from anyone that would have pushed me to go seek help. \n\nI was already pretty drunk this night when my girlfriend asked me to go get food. That trip for food ended up with me in a liquor store and then the bar \"for a few\" which led to me being extremely drunk and depressed. I came back home telling her how bad I wanted to end it all, which God knows she had been through enough with me but wasn't too much support. She took my keys from me and I continued pacing increasingly agitated and couldn't escape the gut wrenching feeling I was having. She eventually couldn't take it anymore and called the cops, who came to talk to me and requested that I had to receive medical treatment, which I know is by law after having suicidal ideations. I continued to refuse because I didn't want to pay the medical bills I had no money for, which eventually led them to forcefully detaining me as i resisted, wrestling with them on the ground, and they then proceeded to tase me 4 different times :) great story right?\n\nI'm not coming here bitching and moaning about how I don't deserve any jail time for resisting \"arrest\" on an officer... but I am extremely disappointed with the legal system in taking NO sympathy for my mental well being. Like the purpose of criminal justice system I feel is to make right with the person so that they become a better functioning member of society... this is NOT going to help me right now. Thinking about feeling how I am right now, in a jail cell, for 3 months. I feel like I am doomed. Not only for how I'm going to feel in there, which is going to be eye gouging torture the whole time, but when I get out.. I dont see myself as being a healthier person than when I came in. Like i've already taken so many positive steps in the past months since that incident.. psych wards (which was terrible), inpatient rehab for alcohol for a month, outpatient alcohol treatment, AA meetings, meeting with my sponsor, having a therapist.. and I'm now SORT of seeing improvement. But not for the rest of this month until I find out. This put me right back to rock bottom hearing this news today and I'm really scared for myself.\n\nThe only plus side that I still have, is that this is just a recommendation to the judge. He doesn't have to take it, and we can say we think the sentence is way too harsh and it can be looked at further. But they often do take it.\n\nIdk why I'm making this post honestly just to get it off my conscious but if anybody has had any similar issues with shitty mental health and going to jail and has any recommendations please let me know. I get sentenced at the end of this month and this is going to be the real jail time of uncertainty in my head up until then :/\n\nTL;DR FML",

You may feel sad, you may feel pain, you may feel guilt, but i get... I've been there. Life may seem unfair, but that's just wrong to say... It doesn't make sense, because in your eyes it never was meant to be. You just wait, for life has just begun for you, destiny approaches but only on simple glances. Looking back you blame everything, you hate everything, you just want to leave, and honestly, I get it. Life is not about unfairness, its about waiting, \"what do you mean?\" you might ask... Well... let me tell you... Life is a line that cant be broken, only to be looked at, it stretches from your birth to your end, it depends on your decisions if it's good or bad but also on you! You see, if Life can't be altered then why claim it's unfair? Well simple questions have simple answers. Life is not something to blame but something to explore, if you were to die right now, you could let all your chances go to waste, you could've been a millionaire or even a cultural figure but if you keep dwelling on the same things that day may never come. Those who go through the hard stuff are the ones who later become the stronger ones or even happier ones and vice a versa, you don't have to blame yourself nor Life that would be completely wrong blame nothing for you just need to Wait... Your life may be boring and disastrous, because you just don't to look to the actual way you should be looking at. Don't focus your mind on the past instead focus on The Future. Don't dwell on the past if it's already happened, maybe focus on not committing the same mistake again. You may grow to be a father, you will raise your kids and pass your knowledge to them, you will see them grow, you will see them smile, you will be happy, just when the day comes where you have seen generations go on you will finally rest. Don't feel sad if you have such a large amount of things you can experience. Happiness can not exist without Pain and Suffering or else people would feel nothing. Everything may seem hopeless but don't waste it, it's one shot at Life and you haven't even aimed yet. Look forward, and just go crazy, do good out there. If you can't then grab help from someone, you are not the only person on Earth and there are people that like, it just takes time, and all you have to do is Wait, think, and wonder what you can do. You can't just stop here! Look up! And see! And please... if all seems lost... please... just... wait...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor now I have to go, and I will come back on your last day when you have done everything you wanted to do and learned everything you wanted to learned... Just for one last time... you smile... and go into a deep sleep right next to your loved ones...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nbut please... don't go...",

I didn\u2019t see it coming, so don\u2019t worry if you are unable to look forward to anything at the moment.\n\nI moved to a big city on my own and somehow didn\u2019t end up lonely. I started working for an animal shelter in my spare time and especially the dogs make me feel responisble and awesome.\n\nI still think about killing myself from time to time. But I don\u2019t see a need to do so, but so many reasons to live.\n\nI am not that illusional to believe that this will go on forever, but I feel like I found myself a little bit. Getting a dog would probably eliminate any suicidal tendencies for the time it lives and I feel like I can finally take care of myself and a pet.\n\nThere were times in which I would just cry, eat and sleep without leaving my house and I am sure that some of you are even worse at the moment. But I am sure that you can always take another risk before eliminating all your chances. I did and it luckily worked out for me. If it doesn\u2019t for you, be reminded, that we support each other.

            "selftext": "I feel like I've noticed a pattern about my mother. In every conversation I have with her, she always bring up her ex husband and how much she hates him. She would his name to insult me and would always say how much I am like him. How much a geek/nerd I am. I wasn't really convinced of my own theory until my mother said \"dwarvemrunes, I love you but I also wish I could change you so weren't fathers son, your are beginning to get arrogant.\" \n\nYeah never mind I am in my junior year of college for degree in biochemistry and doing research. I guess I am just a loser like my alcoholic father who seems to live in your head rent free. And I guess I hide my mental illnesses as well since you told me that actually getting treatment looks bad. The only thing to save my life was I forgot to load the gun. \n\nAnd can some answer this question, is it normal for your parents to say that they will never be your friends and call you a guest in the home you were raised in?",

Episode is called Stupid Piece of Sh** and it's his inner monologue of how he feels.. I watched and felt like that's how I feel!

            "selftext": "I'm in my low 20's and I feel like I peaked in high school and the rest of my life is going to be hell. In high school I had all the \"friends\" in the world, I was an all-state football player, I had great grades, and I had a great social life. When I went to college I started to become depressed because of the change and I shortly left my full academic scholarship behind and when back to my hometown. \n\nIt wasn't all bad though I got a job and become the youngest assistant manager in a Fortune 200 company. I really loved my job, I got to work with all sorts of people and I loved the aspect of running a business. My High School Sweetheart and I had a kid and I had to choose my child or my job and I chose my son. My son's mom had an extremely rough labor and she was down for a while and we didn't have much help, my job wouldn't give me any time off so I had to resign and I tried to find another job.\n\nI couldn't find a job and we went through our savings and my 401k eventually but I became depressed again because I wasn't able to provide for my family and my ex was tired of it so she took my son and left me for her ex. For the past year I've been struggling to get a job and I've been living on my brother's couch. I eat maybe two times a week because I don't like to eat his food and I don't feel like I deserve to eat. I've tried to end my life a few times and now I'm constantly being checked on by family members to make sure I don't commit suicide and I'm hardly ever left alone.\n\nLast week I had my 4th interview for this supervisor position at a national chain and I thought I had the job in the bag because there was over 400 applicants and I was one of the final 3 but they were supposed to call me 2 days ago and my phone never went off. I knew I shouldn't have got my hopes up but I did only to be let down again. For the past year my life has been a constant hell and I don't know what to do. \n\nTL/DR: I feel like I peaked in high school-early adulthood and I can't get myself out of the constant rut I've been in.",

            "selftext": "I have been struggling with anxiety at first, it wasnt bad, it was just a little anxiety, and it got worse, it started 5 years ago, and the anxiety became social anxiety, at this point i felt so bad i cut and self harmed myself, it helped me supress my feelings. My parents found out about it by my teacher, and they screamed at me, my father told me i was making drama, and i needed to get beaten, i got. I started dressing like the oposite gender, because i dont feel good in girls clothes (i am female), and my parents started telling me i looked ugly, and i got beat again by my father, because some people at my church told my dad they saw me kissing a girl, it was a total lie of course, i dressed like a boy, but i liked boys as well. My confidence and self esteem dropped to hell, i feel fat, and ugly, i hate myself, i started starving myself, as much as i could. That one time i felt a lot of apettite, i just supressed myself. I got skinnier, and it didnt solve it, my anxiety became severe, and i started having panick attacks, in which i hear voices, saying everyone hates me, and my boyfriend lies to me, and to me self harm again. I got so tired, i started taking lots of medication, to get high and feel happier, of course it didnt worked, my apettite was non existant. i started smoking marijuana. It felt great again, oh my god, i was able to eat, my anxiety? GONE, it worked for a year. And now it started to really go down... i quit school, i was making me go completely crazy, my parents took me off and it got even worse, here i am now, my axienty is present all time, i cant eat if im not high, my head hurts every second, and i feel like i am slowly going crazy, i beg for help, and no one hear me, they say its teenage drama, i really really really want to die, i feel really bad, my parents wont take me to a doctor, pleasr help me.....",

            "selftext": "Hey guys,\n\nLooking for suggestions here. I'm a mid-twenties, normal-weight female. I've had depression pretty much my whole life and lately my body's new fun thing is constant exhaustion. Profound exhaustion, like I'm about to die. I'm too tired to clean my apartment. Much, much too tired to exercise or study. Even walking like a third of a mile drains me, which is weird because physically my body, lungs, heart, etc are actually in decent shape (normally, I do ballet, intermediate-advanced level). Friends and family have commented on my affect and asked if I'm okay. When I get home from work I just sit there watching TV for five hours and then drag my exhausted body to bed (and I hate watching TV)! Caffeine does nothing. I get a brief burst of moderate energy when I snarf down sugar (and I don't even like sweets) and once the sugar high wears off it's back to a 0. Even brushing my teeth or washing the dishes takes all my energy. When I wake up in the morning I feel like a truck ran over me. I can't get anything done. I had my checkup and got blood work done and they didn't find anything physically wrong (except a slight Vit C deficiency that I'm taking supplements for now, and I haven't noticed any difference in energy since starting that). I am definitely burned out; I haven't had a vacation in over three years (taking a short one next week, which should help, but I don't expect any miracles) but nonetheless this seems excessive. I'm incredibly forgetful too, constantly missing appointments. I feel like I'm slowly suffocating to death. :/ Help?? Thank you! :)",

One was like my dad, and was forced out of his position due to some scandal with the \"replacement\" that was completely out of the first dude's control. Nobody did anything bad, it was just that the pastor wanted the replacement to come instead and just forced the first guy out for no reason.\n\nThe other one stepped down because he wanted to move on in his ministry or whatever.\n\nI had to deal with a stalking situation from my ex that I was with for three years (most likely with sexual intent). I now have ptsd from it.\n\nA friend committed suicide. \n\nAnother friend got offended because I didnt like her new boyfriend (turns out my intuition was correct and a few months later he turned up to be an ass).\n\nI graduated and lost all my teachers. No longer have my swim coach(es) either; one moved away and the other is still there but is a bit inconsistent if you know what I mean.\n\nMy life consisted of swimming, school, and youth group. The youth group fell apart. And since I'm now out of school, the other two are also gone.\n\nMy narc dad pissed me off and now I barely speak to him.\n\nAnd now it seems I have also lost my therapist of all people as well. She was the only one I really had left and now that seems to be over too.\n\nIt hurts so fucking bad.",

Yet I had to attend these sessions post a brawl at school. I felt unwilling to attend at first and my doing the same necessiated a lot of pushing from my family and friends. However, I did like the help and after the first session I readily attended six more.\n\nThat was 1 year ago. The sessions did not have a lasting effect. \n\nRecently things have turned a lot worse. I flunked my Boards with only 87% marks, did not pass the medical or engineering entrance tests and now after dropping an year can't see any explicit academic progress. It would be a shame if I fail again after wasting a year and so much money (for my tutions). Apart from this overbearing anxiety I am always gripped by a feeling of helpnessness. Plus my skepticism prevents myself from finding solace in the belief of a Higher Being who is capable of fixing all my problems.\n\nI have lost contact and am estranged from all my 'friends' (or rather they dumped me). As it was that I was one of the primary topics of their jokes and mockery; their desertion feels a little sad. My social awkwardness and intolerance has thus escalated to the level of myself voluntarily alienating myself from those whose views differ from mine even by miniuscule proportions. As for romance that is something strictly off the charts.\n\nSo I am alone in this hypothetical fall into the dark eternal abyss of hopelessness. My only aim now is to hide this sorrow underneath a fake smile of pseudocontent and makebelieve happiness.  \n\nWith this I sign off. Thanks for bearing with me. Probably this article may make you feel that I am a hopeless case and soneone beyond help (which probably I am). Still the only reason I wrote this article was the faint hope of my relieving some of the burden I bear.",

I have bipolar disorder and I talk about it on here often because it is anonymous, and I talk to my counselor and close people in my life about it just to update on my well being but that\u2019s about it. I don\u2019t feel the need to share it all over the place with people who don\u2019t need to know it about me.

I\u2019m not ashamed of it, but it\u2019s really not a fun thing to live with and I\u2019m gonna treat it but not make it who I am. I don\u2019t know if this is mean but I feel like making consistent posts like that makes people unable to see how serious it really is. I\u2019ve lost so much of my life to it. It\u2019s an active fight every day to stay alive and I don\u2019t really want to make light of it. \nIf it helps you to joke about it that\u2019s good for you, I just don\u2019t really understand even if I want to.

            "selftext": "Cw// self harm ~ this is a stream of concious reflection on my current mental state and probably isnt the most coherent thing to read lol,,,if u happen to have advice or insights I'd appreciate it. It would be nice to know that someone's listening. For background, I'm a college junior currently studying abroad.\n\nI dont like myself. I really really dont. At least, not at this moment. Sometimes I feel a really warm, deep affection for myself and my imperfections, but most of the times, like now, I just feel totally and completely like a waste of space. I've felt like this for sooo long... I look around at other people, people who also might feel depressed and anxious, and they seem full, despite their own issues (I know that seeming doesnt equal actually being). I just feel like I'm lacking something. I'm deficient. And i really dont think I'm worth trying to fix. I'm selfish..and shallow and empty.....and it hurts, it really hurts. \n\nI've never truly opened up to anyone about this. Not my parents, friends, not even my old therapist. If I try, I always feel like I get shut down. Idk if it's the people I'm talking to or if it's me projecting my own repressive tendencies onto them but I've never been able to talk about this. Even 2 years ago (freshman yr), when I cut two deep gashes into my arm at a super low point (( I was lowkey abusing my antidepressants (taking them at random times and knowingly messing with my brain chemistry bc I honestly didnt care abt anything,,,the overall result was tjat I felt very suicidal) When my friends and parents asked and showed concern about them, I blamed it on an accident in my art studio...should I have told the truth? They never brought it up afterwards, even tho I'm pretty sure they knew it was self harm. Why wouldn't they ask? Do they not care about me? I'm not worth the trouble..\n\nI haven't physically self harmed since and stopped taking antidepressants. Things did get better after that. But I still self harmed, unintentionally and subconsciously through constant social isolation. I would purposely sabotage friendships and romantic developments, opting to stay in my room in total isolation. I have social anxiety and depression and haven't really been able to overcome them. I often feel like they define me, like they're personality traits. \n\nBeyond that though, I feel empty. I'm empty. Hollow. My chest feels hollow, but also achy...it hurts. Does depression for hurt anyone else? Sometimes it feels like my heart is breaking, sometimes like it is being torn apart..ripped out. Is that normal for depression? \n\nI've also been dealing with bouts of disassociation after I went thru a psychedelic phase last spring. Periods of disassociating range from annoying to actually terrifying and happen once or twice a week. Idk if they're getting better..\n\nLike I said at the beginning, sometimes I feel ok. In fact, sometimes I feel like my heart is glowing and like I truly belong. Happy. But it can change so fast, turn completely opposite and I feel broken. Am I broken? Deficient. I am deficient. But if you were to ask me how I'm doing, I'll say \"I'm fine,\" no matter what the truth is. I know that that's such a depression cliche, but I've been called out on it. \"Its fine\". I'm very complacent. Idk maybe it's because I dont like disappointing or inconveniencing people. I think that by not voicing my actual thoughts and instead repressing them, I've distanced myself from people to the point where it doesnt matter if they never see me again. I'm like a ghost.\n\nAhh theres so much to unpack here lol I'm sorry. I've been dealing with these feelings since middle school and am now reaching a place where they're very dangerous. No matter how happy i feel one minute, I end up getting really really intense suicidal thoughts.  Tbh,,,everything feels meaningless and half the time I wish I was dead. Lol. Yikes. I hate feeling like this. I really really do. I have so much privilege in life. And I'm wasting it.  Fuck. There are so many people who have actual issues, yet have the capacity to find joy in life. I'm a privileged middle class white girl with loving parents and all these amazing opportunities with no apparent disabilities or hindrances and yet I have the audacity to waste this much time hating myself.\n\nits dumb. I should be able to function like a normal person. But idk maybe I'm not. Maybe I'm not supposed to belong. Idek how to begin to talk about all this to my friends or family.............its so much....and I'm so bad at articulating myself. Idek if they'd care. Or understand. I feel really really alone. Even with my good friends, I feel like if I were to disappear it wouldn't mean anything to them. I'm like a ghost...utterly deficient. Utterly useless and invisible. Empty.\n\nSpiritually deficient...socially deficient....I'm lacking something. I wish I knew how to fix it. Idk if I ever will.\n\nThanks for reading.",

I've tried Prozac, Lexapro, Zoloft, and Wellbutrin, and none of them helped while some even made things worse. Alas, two months ago I was put on Pristiq, and for the first month everything seemed to be going right. Until another month passed and I'm back in my depressed and unmotivated state. I had an appointment with a new psychiatrist today and she put me on Abilify as an add-on to my Pristiq. Has anyone tried this combination before? She also gave me a prescription for Klonopin for my recent spout of insomnia and crippling anxiety! I hope it works this time. If being on 3 different medications - an antidepressant, an antipsychotic, and a benzo - doesn't help, idk what will.",

            "selftext": "I have never really been on reddit, but after doing some desperate googling today and coming across these posts - I signed up. Reading about others similar issues have made me wanna share some of my own - to see if others relate or maybe even have answers. \n\nI am 21 years old and have been struggling mentally since early childhood. Without going into too much detail, I have had a tendency to isolate myself and stay in my bubble. Not really socializing with other peers. We moved and changed houses a lot, almost every year until high school age, and I think this could be an obvious reason for my sense of detachment with other people. I have been sort of content with this for a long time, the outsider feeling, but lately it has been almost unbearable. Not only do I feel as if I struggle relating to people, but relating now to the actual world and myself. To put it simply: I'm starting to lose sense of both society and myself. I don't know who I am, what I am supposed to do - or where I even am. Physically and mentally. \n\nIt hasn't been this difficult before, but maybe I'm just in a phase/period of disassociating? At the same time I don't feel panicky or explicitly sad. More empty and kinda lost in a slow-going way. Like I am stuck in quicksand, but not really sinking, just sitting there and watching everything around me. Limbo. It's pretty quiet, almost comfortable - but if I knew how to get out and run away into something healthier - I'd do it in the blink of a second. \n\nRight now my three biggest issues are these:  \n1. Falling asleep. These last couple nights I've stayed up till pretty late, around 2-5 in the morning. Either I don't feel tired or it's like I don't see the point of sleeping. Not that I have something to occupy myself with, but it's almost like a lucid state. The night feels long and for me to be awake in. I don't know why. This makes me wake up late (12-14) - which obviously disturbs a possible daily routine. At least the one I imagine. Sometimes I feel like it's not even of use to do anything - because I have already wasted the day waking up late. This makes me feel a sense of loss almost every day, but totally put on by myself - which I realize now is quite self-destructing behaviour. I should probably be less hard on myself and ease on the expectation of waking up at 8am into immediate productivity.   \n2. My fucking phone (addiction). Please excuse my language. But I am so tired of watching myself endlessly scrolling and skimming through digital nonsense. Any tips? Even though I guess self-control is the only way. The only thing more depressing than falling asleep late and waking up late is waking up late and then spending/wasting thee hours in bed with my phone in my hand.   \n\n\n3. Dealing with being by myself. If I haven't seen or talked to another person in half a day/a day - the disassociating feelings start to appear. I literally feel the sense of myself and reality slipping, combined with a headache. This was the reason I got on here today. Wondering if this is simply the feeling of loneliness or something else. I think this is also one of the reasons I spend so much time on my phone - to not feel alone.   \n\n\nI feel like maybe abruptly ending this post here. This is most of what I am feeling and can bother writing right now. But if anyone has anything to say, ask or share - please butt in. I'll most likely answer - cause being online and constantly awake is most of what I do. And I'd love to converse with someone other than myself.",

It\u2019s been extremely intoxifying to my mental health and I haven\u2019t felt any better ab it since the day I was diagnosed. I had to suffer thru it all being taken from me, and rapidly. September 2018 I had a full head of hair and by January 2018 I was completely bald, head to toe. It seems like nothing is worse than this. It has me completely heart broken, and no amount of therapy can help me. I\u2019m on 20mg of Lexapro too for anxiety and depression. I\u2019m very self conscious, have a very low self esteem, and highly hate myself. So yeah, I also have had mental problems in the past, but now it has became even worse then it ever possibly could.

            "selftext": "When I was younger and felt disheartened by some aspect of life, I often turned to stories for guidance. In most of the stories the protagonists went through a lot of loss and suffering, which inspired me to fight on with my own relatively petty problems. The difference I eventually realised, is that they suffered for a cause. I won't say their suffering was easy, pain is pain, but there is a stark difference between them and me. My suffering is meaningless, and it inflicts a pain that is both mental and philosophical. Pain causes us to ask ourselves why we are suffering and why we should continue to suffer. When we have no answers to these questions what is there to do but to lose hope and look towards the nearest exit?\n\nWith no cause, the only thing worthwhile left in life is pleasure. If life is mostly pleasureable, then we have a reason to endure the pain. But what about the opposite? I used to look toward the future for potential turning points in my life, and though I was mostly left dissapointed, I couldn't help but think the next one might be different. Now I'm afraid that I'm pretty much out of those and I have to come to terms with the fact that this really is all there is to be to my life. The stories that used to comfort me now remind me of how pointless my suffering is. There is a popular saying that goes along the lines of \"I wish not for an easy life, but the strength to endure a difficult one\". That is how I feel about suffering. I understand that pain is inevitable, I just want a reason to keep on enduring.",

            "selftext": "So long story short, I started therapy again recently and this therapist recommended I switch from Celexa to Wellbutrin. I was taking 10mg Celexa daily for almost 3 years (it seriously saved my life), so I talked to my doctor who said I could start the Wellbutrin (150mg) and then taper off the Celexa.\n\nSilly me went about tapering off the wrong way - I started the Wellbutrin and took half a Celexa (5mg) for about a week. After that, I probably should have taken a half Celexa every other day, but instead, I just stopped entirely after the one week. \n\nIt's been about 2 weeks without Celexa now and the hardest side-effect to deal with is constantly feeling like I'm gonna pass out. I'm fine if I'm sitting or lying down, but the minute I stand up &amp; walk around, it's woozy city. It kind of feels a little like being on a roller coaster (but not as fun). Some days are better than others, but it doesn't seem to be getting better with time, which concerns me. I feel fine psychically otherwise, and I'm able to function, but it's definitely annoying.\n\nThe other not-so-fun side-effect I've noticed are mini depressive episodes, where all of a sudden, I'll just get overwhelmingly sad for no reason.  It hits me like a truck - one minute I'm totally fine, and then next, I want to burst into tears. Sometimes it's triggered - once it happened when I was listening to a song, and it's happened while I've been watching TV, but other times, it just hits me out of nowhere. They don't last very long, which is good, but again - very, very annoying.\n\nSo I guess I'm wondering just how long this will last. Has anyone else had a similar experience coming off Celexa? I was on a relatively low dose, so I know my side-effects are probably not as bad as they could be, but still. It's making me sad because all I feel are these side-effects so I haven't been able to notice any changes with the Wellbutrin. I have a follow-up appt with my doctor next week to discuss how it's going, but I figured this would be a good place not only to vent, but to seek info as well. Thanks for listening!! :)",

            "selftext": "First post here, been following for the last couple of months. \n\nI've always known that I've had what I've deemed as slow burn depression, some call it \"high functioning depression\", \"moderate depression\", etc. It's always been there, periods off an on, some long, some quick, but seems to always be on a cycle. \n\nI did about 6 months of therapy when I was about 14-15 when my mom found out I was cutting and was on Paxil for that time period as well. \n\nI had a pretty good period up through my esrly-mid 20's of not having a lot of cycling but since about 27 (29 now) it's been way more present. \n\nI've always been the funny friend willing to crack a joke to lighten the mood or get a laugh as it's been a small joy for me. However on the large part I've always had issues with experiencing joy. I've always been cynical, skeptical, pretty introverted (faking extroversion), neurotic, and generally angry. \n\nI had an awful job from 25-27 which really kicked the cycle back into full swing where I really went into self medicating with alcohol and THC. I got into a different job which I generally enjoy but has caused it's own problems. \n\nI recent split from my wife of 5 years (7 together). When we split our son was 10 months old and is now almost 14 months. The relationship itself was a slow burn into collapse and I ended up cheating on her which she found out later and we're in the process of a divorce. We're splitting time with our son about 50-50. I'm still together with the woman I had the affair with and were dating, it's overall great however about a month ago we found out she was pregnant (got through birth control). Side note, I completed a 2 month scheduled vasectomy 2 days after we found out she was pregnant. After a lot of discussion we decided to keep the baby (she has 3 children from a previous relationship as well). \n\nAll of this has really kicked my cycle into full swing. I know it's stressing her out as well because with my depression I go into numb robot mode where I take on any and every household task I can find to complete. This is exaggerated even more because I know the pregnancy is physically exhausting her so I do even more. This compounds into me becoming exhausted and I'm having a lot of trouble keeping the mask on. \n\nThis has led into a lot of negative thought and feelings that I'm getting what I've deserved. This is now leading to the thoughts of hopelessness, shutting myself off from those around me (haven't decided when/how to tell those in our lives), indifference in most things in my life. \n\nI'm at a loss here and just looking for support, kind words...shit, anything. Hope.",

Constantly I find myself thinking non stop about whats happening and all the time that I am currently wasting been this type of a person , I just think of it as a phase and hopefully it will pass just to somehow stay on a positive note but its not really helping . On a side note now I start having regrets of thing I done to other people when I wasn\u2019t feeling myself of maybe drunk and I don\u2019t know how I should apologize to them. As I have mentioned I am stuck in my own head thinking like maybe I just should ignore it and stop thinking but as you all know that\u2019s nearly impossible. I also find myself losing a lot of sleep and start to have random mental breakdowns. I just hope that soon this feeling goes away and I have a purpose back again. Thanks",

I am not a social being, not so open with others; typical introvert and i know that's quite different from being depressive. This is getting worse, i don't seem to find the energy to do anything, not even eat. I put off my studies, the exams, family ! Everything feels like a burden to me. I don't want to see anyone, not even my mom; i don't nobody to be around too. I don't feel like doing anything, beside laying in bed, and staring at the ceiling purpouselessly. Even my body moves slower, my words, my thoughts, just everything in me. It could have something to do with my cycle and so, but it's just too extreme and worse. I can't focus on anything. All i am doing all day is staring at my phone and lauphing at any possible, silly memes and then ask myself absurdly what am i doing? I don't have have any suicidal thoughts to be honest, but i feel purposeless, useless and hopeless and better non-existent.",

            "selftext": "(sorry english is not my native language so i may be weirdly speaking) Hi, i'm a 20F student in college, first year. Well actually it's my fourth 1st year, i changed my \"study subject\" a few times.\nMy big problem is that i have to read several scientific books, and i can't seem to focus for more than 5 lines without forgetting what i've just read, so i have to re-read them, and once again i forget everything, and so on\n\nYesterday i managed to (slowly) read a few pages, but earlier today when i started to read again, i noticed that i forgot everything that i read yesterday.\n\nWhen i read my mind won't stay on the book, i'm always thinking about video games, other classes, what i'll do when i'll be back home, or sometimes i just stare at the blanks between two words for a few seconds (just enough time to make me forget what i was reading)\n\nI had several \"depressions\" in my life, globally, i feel like i don't belong anywhere neither in the social sphere or the professionnal sphere, i don't know what to do after i graduate, i just found an interesting subject to follow for now, i suffer of quite severe social anxiety, i'm all alone all day at college. I have a boyfriend who moved several hundreds of miles from me for his own studies, i have a few friends that i managed to make on the internet, but i still feel lonely most of the time. I know i have a better situation that many of real depressed people here, but i can't help it, i'm just not okay.\n\nI tried many things to work and read, i tried at home, at college, in silence, with music in my ears, i tried wooden chairs, comfy chairs, beds, i even tried reading and working with white noise.\nI tried natural soft medication in order to sleep more, hoping that i would not feel half-tired all the time\n\nI'm so scared of failing. Everytime i loose focus i can hear one of my teachers in my head saying \"you only have 15 hours of classes per week, but that's because you have to work and read for another 15 hours per week! College teaches you self discipline!\" And i can't do that it stresses me so much. I'm so lost, i don't know what to do, the only thing i know is that i can't let things go their way, but i don't know how to do that.",

With this being my first time seeing a therapist or \"opening up about my feelings, thoughts, or issues,\" my first experience became quite awkward and felt bizarre from the beginning.\n\nIn the beginning, they opened up with short, vague, or broad questions, and this is where I got the idea to begin talking. I talked for what felt like hours, even though the session lasted a mere hour, and I was having trouble finding words or accurately depicting my thoughts or situations, frankly because they were staring at me and weren't saying anything.\n\nI felt as if I was under an immense amount of pressure to talk, which only made me uncomfortable. Not uncomfortable in the sense I was not open to talk about it, but rather the direction of the discussion. \n\nThey began to be more involved towards the last 10 minutes of the sessions, which was when I felt a greater connection with back and forth engagement, which I felt was the most productive portion of the session. I took their advice and schedule to meet with them again on Monday, however if I things are moving too slow or I don't feel as if it has been productive enough, would I be out of line to try a new therapist? \n\nSimilarly, how common or uncommon is it to blankly gaze at the wall or out a window when talking during therapy? \n\nFor a quick background, this was my first time seeing any sort of therapy or counseling, I'm not on any medications or have any past experiences or issues related to mental health. I felt that I was in a slumber and lacked motivation is all.",

I was taking so much Effexor that it amounted to two pills of different doses in the morning, and then two more in the afternoon just to wade off the awful withdrawal symptoms at night. I would sweat like crazy in my sleep for no reason, and would sometimes have vivid dreams and difficulty waking. \n\nIn order to deal with this withdrawal, my psych switched me to desvenlafaxine/pristiq. Has anyone here ever switched a medicine and a month in realized what a bad idea it was? It started with a week of dizziness and vomiting like I never experienced before. I even thought I could be pregnant, it was that bad. This was followed by weeks of nausea and more fatigue than I had experienced in the last while. I'm always tired, but this is a heavy fog that makes it difficult to study or focus.   \n\n\nI've also experienced higher blood pressure and more anxiety. None of these are serious side effects, but serious enough that I will be switching back to venlafaxine with the help of my doctor.   \n\n\nI'm just frustrated that I feel like I have wasted time on my health by switching to something that is supposedly almost identical to what I was on before, and yet it ruined much of my september. I am thankful I have the means to get medicine but the way it screws with my body is one of the most frustrating things about being sick. I hate having timers on my phone to remember to take things and I hate even more the side effects of everything I take.",

            "selftext": "Hello everyone, I\u2019m new here. I might sound really stupid for asking - Should I get back on my Prozac? I\u2019m asking because I\u2019ve been off of it for almost a year. I\u2019m diagnosed with clinical depression, General anxiety disorder, Panic disorder, social anxiety, insomnia, PTSD, BPD, and possibly bipolar. I used to self harm but after I got out of rehab last year, I\u2019ve stopped. I haven\u2019t had the best life or best luck. I was raised by grandma who was the only person I could truly talk to (sadly she passed away in 2015) and her birthday is tomorrow. I can\u2019t sleep because my mind never shuts off. I\u2019m currently not working because I fractured my left hand at work and was fired the next day because apparently I didn\u2019t tell the hiring manager I had scoliosis but I did tell her, they\u2019re just trying to cover their butts. Anyway, I\u2019m also a recovering opiate addict. I\u2019ve been doing really good, in December I\u2019ll be a year sober. But lately, I\u2019ve been having horrible cravings. When I can fall asleep, I wake up in panic from having vivid \u201cdope dreams\u201d. I\u2019m currently prescribed Valium for my anxiety &amp; ptsd &amp; to prevent seizures , restoril for insomnia and subutex for opiate cravings but it also helps with my scoliosis pain. My psychiatrist recently suggested I get back on Prozac but he gave me a lower dose than I was on. He said think about it and gave me a script. Apart of me wants to get on it because I\u2019ve isolated myself, I don\u2019t wanna leave my house, I\u2019m having horrible thoughts, Hell I can\u2019t even take my dog for a walk but then again I\u2019m scared because it\u2019s just more medication I\u2019m taking. I\u2019m sorry for the rant but I really don\u2019t have anyone to talk to and if I do try to talk to anyone, \u201cit\u2019s all in my head\u201d or \u201cmental illness isn\u2019t real\u201d \nWhat would you do?",

Sometimes I don\u2019t have the answer or solution to my problems but just simply communicating how I feel, makes me feel better and anytime I do see the doctor I just get chucked pills. \nI attend college Mon-Friday and work Thursday, Sat and Sunday\u2019s and support my BF with his gigs at the weekend during the night. Lately I\u2019ve been feeling overworked, emotional and aggravated. I\u2019ve been attempting to use methods to help cope from my previous counsellor and I still feel unsatisfied. I can\u2019t miss college or work or I fall into more debt but feel like I don\u2019t even have time to breathe.\n\nHow do I find balance?",

            "selftext": " So, about a month ago I was prescribed Wellbutrin 100mg made by Actavis. I was told to take 1 pill once a day for the first week. Long story short, I lost my leg in a lawn mower accident when I was three years old. I had a pretty rough childhood as far as issues with my parents divorcing and both turning into addicts, my every day life, etc. so a lot of my issues begin there. Fast forward to 23yo with countless surgeries, insecurities, depression, and anxiety I\u2019ve now finally been introduced to this medicine.\n\nThe reviews were pretty much 50/50 as far as side affects and overall help goes. I was in a dark place before I started this prescription. I hated doing anything that had to do with leaving my apartment. I was in a constant \u201cfog.\u201d I was always on edge and my anxiety would get worse every day.\n\n\nThe first week being on Wellbutrin I noticed a big difference in my overall attitude and outlook on things. Idk if it was just a placebo affect or what, but it worked. The only side affects I really noticed was \u201cweird\u201d dreams. They weren\u2019t scary, just weird. Occasionally I\u2019d get a bad headache, but it was only temporary. Cotton mouth did occur, but it wasn\u2019t terrible.\n\n\nFast forward to about the 4th week, I can feel my anxiety/depression slowly coming back. I feel more on edge than the past two-three weeks. I now take 1 pill twice a day, and even though it\u2019s slowly reoccurring, it\u2019s not near as bad as before I started Wellbutrin.\n\nAll in all, I\u2019ve seen a major change in myself for the good. Of course this drug isn\u2019t going to clear all of my daily issues, but it does help me cope and get through the day.",

For those wondering, I feel emotionally numb, lost my sense of humour and I lost my purpose. The meds sucked the life out of me more than the depression, its basically as effective as a Dyson aspirator. Medication is poison for the brain, if you don't believe me look up Peter Breggin. I would rather get hit by fucking depression like a thunderstorm any day, then feel nothing like Captain Barbossa in Pirates of the Caribbean.

My hair was cut short to manage it better and I\u2019d just take some off here and there when I was alone. I had a turbulent childhood but not always bad. Dealt with things in my own way. Or maybe didn\u2019t deal so well hence the hair cutting. I had a shoebox full of hair as a teenager and had to secretly throw it out to avoid questions by family. As an adult, I go through waves of feeling that feeling of needing to cut my hair to get it just right. I know I\u2019m depressed and anxious but I am not on meds for that. I\u2019m on adhd stimulants. Anyway, I really must be going through something now because I took thinning shears to my hair and that was a fail. It\u2019s like the worst one of my cuts yet. And I keep trying to fix it. Spoiler alert: it\u2019s not looking better. It just feels so good to cut it- I can\u2019t explain it. Is this a feeling that resonates with anyone else? I dye my hair at times and it turns out bad and needs to be fixed (mental health low moments). This is all very interesting yet I do need to address it. Please tell me I\u2019m not the only one!",

Some of us have a habit of making terrible friends, and this monster is no different. What a leech. It just kinda hangs out on your back or in your skull, or, more annoyingly, right behind your eyes. Sometimes I wonder, because I can't remember, if there was ever a time when we weren't friends. I have tried to sever our ties on more than one occasion, but you have a way of sneaking back in and going unnoticed until it's too late. Why do you make me so mad? Most of the time you aren't even doing anything, but just you being here INFURIATES me. I AM FURIOUS. And I hate being mad! In my wildest dreams I am a child and we've never met, and it seems like you don't even exist, but then I hear you calling out to me from beyond the dream, and I wake up with you by my side. You have that going for you, your loyalty. I know I can always call on you, and you will be there no matter what. You've  never actually let me down when I've needed you, and I won't deny that I've needed you at times. There are times when I've been content enough to push you away, but inevitably I will sense your absence and seek you out once more. I can't leave you alone like that. I know you wouldn't do that to me. What are friends for, anyway?   \n\n\nI don't know what that was all about, I just had to write some words. This might not be the right place for them, but there they are, I'll delete the post if it violates any rules or anything.",

I was doing everything perfectly but once the parallel park came up I bumped the curve and instant failed. It\u2019s raining today and there was also a bush in the road the blew in to where I had to be so I felt it was a bit unfair but that\u2019s life. With everything else going on though it makes me feel terrible.\nI got the job I was waiting months for and i feel miserable everyday. I can\u2019t say anything since so many people pulled strings for me and it pays well so I just grit the pain and bare it. \nI have a girlfriend but it\u2019s long distance so not having her with me to talk whenever sucks since we live on opposite sides of the world. It\u2019s hard sometimes to find time to text and we barely get to call if at all with our schedules.\nAround this time last year I tried killing myself as well. I was hospitalized for 12 days. Reason being the abuse I experienced as a kid and while I\u2019ll never admit it to anyone, I miss my ex boyfriend so much. I truly feel like he was the one and while typing this I cry thinking about how nice things were. I understand it couldn\u2019t work but it hurts.\nMy friends are busy with work too. He got a job and I\u2019m happy for him but it seems like we barely get to hang anymore. I miss my homie you know. I know I can always turn to him but with work it\u2019s so hard to make happen and I don\u2019t expect him to drop a job to help me. \nIf it wasn\u2019t for some people who rely on me and my dad, I would be trying to kill myself right now. And the straw that broke the camels back was a driving test? It\u2019s stupid, I know. It hurts like a bitch though.",

            "selftext": "Yesterday morning I received an invite to join a facebook group dedicated saving a friend fo mine, with the photo of the guy I've known since elementary school, posted by his best friend and guy I knew growing up as well.  It chilled me to the bone, without context I had to reach out and see what was going on, and it turns out my friend decided to take the route of ending it all.\n\nThis reality sucks, I've known the guy most of my life, and last time I saw him he verbally abused me and told his wife \"we used to bully this guy growing up, he's kind of a nerd.\"  Which... wasn't the person I grew up with, wasn't the person I knew as a child, why was he putting on a front?  I severed all ties with the guy, knowing he became someone he wasn't.  \n\nHis best friend told me last night that he was trying to put on a front to impress his wife, he wanted to prove to her how awesome he was, by being a dick to literally the few people who considered him a friend.  He was always kind of a weird guy, a bit quirky, all around impulsive, and it put off people.  He wasn't the easiest person to be friends with due to his impulsive nature and his quirkiness.  But come to find out, his family didn't provide the greatest of support nets, his funeral was a reason to party and get drunk, his funeral wasn't a moment to mourn a lost family member, no-one even acknowledged he was gone.  When his best friend talked to the aunt of his lost friend, she said \"we all knew he was going to do it eventually\" and rolled her eyes, then walked away.\n\nI'm entirely heartbroken in multiple ways, and frankly, I'm livid about the lack of empathy, and the complete lack of care given to this guy.  I want to tell everyone who is in a similar situation, ending it is not the best solution, there are people out there who love you, there are people out there who care, I for one would have traveled to the world's end for this guy if I knew he was in need.  \n\nYou can't pick your parents, you can't pick your bloodline, but you can pick your family, toxic environments can be removed from your lives, build a support net for yourselves, all of you.  If your blood doesn't have your back, your friends may, and let your friends be your family.  If your parents aren't supportive, cut them out of your lives, the people who listen are the ones who care, surround yourselves with them.  Pick your families, pick your support nets, don't let toxic people ruin who you are, and don't let it push you over the edge.\n\nAll of you guys and gals are loved.",

I started to understand and perceive more about what was happening around me. My dad was an alcoholic, he was depressed. My mom is in constant pain due to her physical disabilities. My step dad is in pain as well. Which leaves me and my siblings to help out with cleaning, dishes, etc.\nBut I'm the only one of my four siblings who actually helps. It's so exhausting and draining. I'm treated by them like my problems aren't worth anything and like I'm just a crybaby. I don't have the motivation to get out of bed. I've thought of killing myself, but I've never made plans or thought vividly of it. I used to hurt myself and I guess I've improved but I still am stuck in this rut and I can't get out.\nMy brother used to tell me to kill myself, to die in a hole, etc. he started saying that stuff to me when I was 7-8 and it hurt my feelings at the time, but it started getting worse as time passed.\nA lot of the time I'll have intense panic attacks the moment I wake up because I don't have the energy to go to school. It's so mentally draining.\nI just feel alone and hopeless :(",

I look around and I see people laughing, groups of friends, people able to focus and be motivated to do their work. How does anyone go throughout their day not being in complete agony. I just sit in the back of the class feeling numb. I don\u2019t do my work. I just put my head down w my headphones in. I have to go throughout my day pretending that I\u2019m okay. It\u2019s like I have to pretend to be someone that I\u2019m not. Everyone in my life thinks I\u2019m this happy goofy love able person when I\u2019m reality I\u2019m someone completely different. I wish I was actually the person that I pretend to be. I don\u2019t want to let anyone see the real me because In the past it\u2019s only ruined my relationships. Why would anyone want to love someone as broken as me. How can someone else accept me when I can\u2019t even accept myself. I wish I was someone else. Living this life in the shell of someone else is torture. I just want to be normal. It would be so much easier to just die",

I was basically, a walking corpse.\n\nNF's music helped me to vent, made me feel better while listening to it, hopeless when not hearing it. Technically, it drowned me even more, chaining myself to the heartbreak that I'll live with a much shorter lifespan. \n\nOne day, I woke up, I realised, *where did all the time go?*\n\nFor some unknown reason, I invited my friends to watch anime at the theaters. \n\nI was alive, for the longest time in my life, and had a resounding effect on me. I was still depressed, rejecting every positive thought that comes in my head, to feel no more disappointment. But I continued watching.\n\nOne month later, I fell in love with anime. Your Lie in April currently was my therapy, and out of a sudden, it motivated me. But I'm no longer rejecting it.\n\n\"We are where we are because of the choices we made.\"\n-Sakura, I Want To Eat Your Pancreas\n\nThough I am sick, or could be not, one thing's for sure.
