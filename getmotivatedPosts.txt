[Text] Soon I will be gone forever, but that's okay as long as someone reads this
I am only 24 years old, yet I have actually already chosen my last tie. It’s [the one that I will wear on my funeral](http://i.imgur.com/Ln8Yyqf.jpg?1) a few months from now. It may not match my suit, but I think it’s perfect for the occasion. 

The cancer diagnosis came too late to give me at least a tenuous hope for a long life, but I realized that the most important thing about death is to ensure that you leave this world a little better than it was before you existed with your contributions . The way I’ve lived my life so far, my existence or more precisely the loss of it, will not matter because I have lived without doing anything impactful.

Before, there were so many things that occupied my mind.  When I learned how much time I had left, however, it became clear which things are really important. So, I am writing to you for a selfish reason. I want to give meaning to my life by sharing with you what I have realized:

* Don’t waste your time on work that you don’t enjoy.
It is obvious that you cannot succeed in something that you don’t like.
Patience, passion, and dedication come easily only when you love what you do.

* It’s stupid to be afraid of others’ opinions. Fear weakens and paralyzes you. If you let it, it can grow worse and worse every day until there is nothing left of you, but a shell of yourself. Listen to your inner voice and go with it. Some people may call you crazy, but some may even think you‘re a legend.

* Take control of your life
Take full responsibility for the things that happen to you. Limit bad habits and try to lead a healthier life. Find a sport that makes you happy. Most of all, don’t procrastinate. **Let your life be shaped by decisions you made, not by the ones you didn’t.**

* Appreciate the people around you
Your friends and relatives will always be an infinite source of strength and love. That is why you shouldn’t take them for granted. 

It is difficult for me to fully express my feelings about the importance of these simple realizations, but I hope that you will listen to someone who has experienced how valuable time is. 

I'm not upset because I understand that the last days of my life have become meaningful. I only regret that I will not be able to see a lot of cool stuff that should happen soon like the creation of AI, or Elon Musk’s next awesome project. I also hope that the war in Syria and Ukraine will end soon.

We care so much about the health and integrity of our body that until death, we don’t notice that the body is nothing more than a box - a parcel for delivering our personality, thoughts, beliefs and intentions to this world. If there is nothing in this box that can change the world, then it doesn’t matter if it disappears. I believe that we all have potential, but it also takes a lot of courage to realize it.  

You can float through a life created by circumstances, missing day after day, hour after hour. Or, you can fight for what you believe in and write the great story of your life. 
I hope you will make the right choice.

Leave a mark in this world. 
Have a meaningful life, whatever definition it has for you. Go towards it. The place we are leaving is a beautiful playground, where everything is possible. Yet, we are not here forever. Our life is a short spark in this beautiful little planet that flies with incredible speed to the endless darkness of the unknown universe. So, enjoy your time here with passion. Make it interesting. Make it count!

Thank you!

[text] If You had $86,400 in your bank and someone stole $10 would you spend all the rest of your money trying to get revenge? Exactly, so if someone puts 10 seconds of negativity in your life don't spend the next 86,400 seconds of the day thinking about it. Stay positive, keep smiling!!
I meant 86,390 seconds of the day left, my bad.
Thanks for the support!

[Discussion] There's One Hundred Days left in 2018. If you're making your goals, keep going. If you're struggling, keep going. If you've just begun, keep going. If you start today, one hundred days will change your life.
In the last two days, I have been *blown the fuck away* by the responses this community has shared.  

I've seen some pretty loathsome things - people trying to demotivate myself and others from achieving their goals, disparaging me for potentially inspiring someone to harm themselves if they can't make those goals.

I've seen struggle and words of reinforcement. People who are going through all kinds of heart break and loss, people searching their souls for worth and identity, and those of you who've admitted to falling short of their own expectations

More than all of those combined, I've seen victories and new goals set.  'Victory,' to me, means you accomplished something, you're carrying on, or you've been invigorated with renewed energy to push forward.

To the demotivators, I'm so sorry you felt the need to try and drive the hopes and dreams of others away, especially on this thread. Sure, front page, visible to everyone, I must have been asking for it. Honestly, I took your words as reverse psychology, regardless of your intent. Communities like this carry on because we find our motivation from within - and your influence isn't a part of that. 

To the strugglers - don't listen to the detractors. Your efforts will pay off in the end, even if they need adjustment over time. Plan change, and they can be hard, but the goals can still be attained. No voice - supportive or not - should be louder than your internal mantra. You win because *you* want to. Everyone else can eat dust.

To the accomplished, or the nearly there - you don't need anything from me but an enthusiastic high five. You know what you're doing and you're succeeding. Bloody well done.

I'm so happy to have had a moment in the sunshine of your lives (or the gloomy clouds, depending on your outlook). You've impressed and inspired me well beyond my own expectations.

I want to put together a sub maybe called /r/One_Hundred_Days or /r/Keep_Going, but I know nothing about CCS or integrating any kind of bots people could use to track their efforts and create a wholesome community of positive support, with enough Mods that can deter the inevitable troll. If you want to do this with me, or without, please let me know. I strongly believe that community can succeed and be a great example to others.

Thank you, everyone, and especially the mods of /r/GetMotivated for keeping this place relatively free of the despairing.

Most of all, Keep Going

[TEXT] I just finished the online Coursera course "Learning how to learn". I highly recommend it to everyone and I summarized everything I learned from it.
>So I just finished the course https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn and I can say that it has actually changed the way I perceive my studies. I strongly recommend it to anyone willing to put some efforts to change the way you learn.  
  
>If you are like me, and you got tired of all the click-bait rubbish that surrounds the productivity articles and advices you will find on the internet, then this is the course for you, and it is the last course you need. 
  
>Almost every single video of the course references a bunch of scientific papers. It is almost entirely based on scientific researches. It introduces you lightly to the concept of how the brain function, how memory works, why procrastination happens, and so many other related subjects that include practical tips on how to learn more efficiently.  
  
> In addition to all the lectures, the course features a lot of interviews with highly prolific scientists and some  notable people like Nelson Dellis, the four-time USA Memory Champion.  
  
> Without further ado, here are all the notes I wrote down while taking the course, organized in a chronological order that follows the course structure.  
  

&nbsp;  
> Edit: As some of you have pointed out, the book [**A mind for numbers**](https://www.amazon.com/Mind-Numbers-Science-Flunked-Algebra-ebook/dp/B00G3L19ZU) is the book that the MOOC was based on. Dr, Barbara Oakley, the author of the book, is a woman who started learning mathematics at the age of 26, and is now a professor of engineering at the university of Oakland.

##Week 1: What is Learning?
---

&nbsp;  
**Brain Facts:**

* Cells of the nervous system are called neurons. Information from one neuron flows to another neuron across a synapse. Human brain has a million billion synapses.

* Your brain creates synapses whenever you learn something new. Sleeping helps "update" your brain cells. Literally.

&nbsp;  
**Why do we procrastinate (scientifically):**

**Problem:**

Learning a new thing or doing something you would rather not do can be stressing. This can cause anxiety at first. This activates the area associated with pain in the brain.

Your brain looks for a way to stop that negative feeling by switching your attention to something else more pleasant.

**Solution:**

The trick is to just start. Researchers discovered that not long after people start actually working out what they didn’t like, that neuro-discomfort disappeared. 

Remember that the better you get at something, the more enjoyable it can become.

Consider using the pomodoro technique.

&nbsp;  
**Learning hard and abstract things:**

The more abstract something is, the more important it is to practice to create and strengthen neural connections to bring the abstract ideas to reality for you.

**Ex**: You should practice a lot with the math vocabulary to understand it and recall it easier.
[∫∞e^x dx, k!(n−k)!]


&nbsp;  
**Summary of what I learnt:**

1. There are two modes of thinking:

    1. **Focused mode:** Concentrating on things that are usually familiar.

    2. **Diffused mode:** A relaxed mode of thinking "your thoughts are free to wander".

2. When you don’t desire doing/learning something, go through it and just start. The discomfort goes away and, in the long term, this will lead to satisfaction.

3. When you learn something new, make sure to take time to rest, then come back to it and recall what you learnt. 

    3. This is very important. Don’t cram information in one day. This leads to inefficient learning. It’s like building a wall without letting it dry.

    4. Revisiting and practicing what you learn is important. Research shows that **spaced repetition** (repeating things after few days) is the best way to build and strengthen the synaptic connections.

4. Sleep is very important. It clears the metabolic toxins from the brain after a day of "brain use". It is best to sleep directly after learning new things.

5. It was shown that exercising and/or being in a rich social environment helps your brain produce new neurons. Don’t lock yourself in your room. Stay active and spare time for exercise (including general physical activities) and friends daily.

##Week 2: Chunking
---

&nbsp;  

**Chunks:**

Pieces of information, neuroscientifically speaking, bond together through use and meaning. They can get bigger and more complex, but at the same time, they are single easy to access items that can fit into the slot of the working memory. 

* **Chunking** is the act of grouping concepts into compact packages of information that are easier for the mind to access.

* **Example**: If you understand and practice a math formula. You no longer will need to focus much to solve it like you did the first time. That’s because your "formula chunk" got so abstracted into your brain that it can only take one slot of your working memory to solve it.

&nbsp;  
**Turn off distractions**. You want to use all the four slots of your working memory when studying. Learning will be inefficient if some of those slots are connected to something else.

&nbsp;  
**You have to solve the problem yourself.** Just because you see it, or even understand it, doesn't mean that you will be able to solve it (**Illusion of competence**). It is always easier to look at the material, even if you think it’s easy, then doing it yourself.

&nbsp;  
**It gets easier.** When you think that a chapter or a book has too much information and that there’s no way to go through them all; just focus on whatever section you’re studying. You’ll find that once you put that first concept in your mental library, the following one will be easier.

This concept is called **Transfer**; a chunk you have mastered in one area can often help you much more easily learn other chunks of information in different areas.

&nbsp;  
**Master the major idea** and then start getting deeper. However, make sure not to get stuck in some details before having a general idea. Practice to help yourself gain mastery and sense of the big picture context. Try taking a "picture walk" before you dig through the material, this means, look briefly at the pictures, chapter titles, formulas used… before diving into details.

&nbsp;  
**Recall mentally** without looking at the material. This is proven more effective than to simply rereading. Reread only after you try to recall and write down what was in the material.

Consider recalling when you are in different places to become independent of the cues from any giving location. This will help you when taking a test in the class.

&nbsp;  
**Test yourself** to make sure you are actually learning and not fooling yourself into learning. Mistakes are a good thing. They allow you to catch illusions of competence. 

&nbsp;  
**Don’t always trust your initial intuition. Einstellung** problem (a German word for Mindset). An idea or a neural pattern you developed might prevent a new better idea from being found. Sometimes your initial intuition on what you need to be doing is misleading.You’ve to unlearn old ideas and approaches as you are learning new ones.

&nbsp;  
**Mix up the problems (Interleaving)** from different chapters. This is helpful to create connections between your chunks. It can make your learning a bit more difficult, but it helps you learn more deeply. Interleaving is very important. It is where you leave the world of practice and repetition, and begin thinking more independently.

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
**Don’ts:**

* Highlighting too much and creating maps are often ineffective without recalling.

* Repeating something you already learnt or know very well is **easy**. It can bring the **illusion of competence**; that you’ve mastered the full material when you actually just know the easy stuff. Balance your studies and focus on the more difficult (**deliberate practice**). This sets the difference between a good student and a great student.

* A big mistake is to blindly start working on an exercise without reading the textbook or attending the class. This is a recipe of sinking. It’s like randomly allowing a thought to pop off in the focus mode without paying attention to where the solution truly lies.

##Week 3: Procrastination and Memory
---

&nbsp;  

**Procrastination:**

* The routine, habitual responses your brain falls into when you try to do something hard or unpleasant. Focusing only on making the present moment feels better.

* Unlike procrastination which is easy to fall into, Willpower is hard to come by. It uses a lot of neural resources and you shouldn’t waste it on fending off procrastination except when really necessary. You actually don’t need to.

* The long-term effect of Procrastination can be dangerous. Putting your studies off leads to studying becoming even more painful. Procrastination is a habit that affects many areas of your life, if you improve in this area, many positive changes will unfold.

* Procrastination shares features with addiction. At first, it leads you to think that if you study too early you’ll forget the material. Then, when the class is ahead of you, it leads you to think that you are inadequate or that the subject is too hard.

* You want to avoid cramming which doesn’t build solid neural structures, by putting the same amount into your learning, and spacing it over a long period by starting earlier.

&nbsp;  
**First time learning something:**

* The first time you do something the deluge of information coming at you would make the job seem almost impossibly difficult. But, once you've chunked it, it will be simple. 

* At first, it's really hard, later it's easy. It becomes like a habit. **Ex:** Driving for the first time.

&nbsp;  
**Habits:**

* Neuro-scientifically speaking, chunking is related to habit.

* Habit is an energy saver. You don’t need to focus when performing different habitual tasks.

* Habits can be good or bad, brief or long.

&nbsp;  
**Habits Parts:**

1. **The cue**: The trigger that launches you into zombie mode (habitual routine).

    1. Recognize what launches you in zombie procrastination mode:

        1. Location. Time. Feelings. Reaction to people or events…

    2. Consider shutting your phone/internet for brief periods of time to prevent most cues.

2. **The routine**: Routine you do in reaction to the cue.

    3. You only need to use your willpower to change your reaction to the cues.

    4. Actively focus on rewiring your old habits.

        2. You need a plan. You need some willpower.

3. **The reward**: Habits exist because they reward us.

    5. Give yourself bigger rewards for bigger achievements. But after you finish them.

        3. **Ex**: If I study for 4 hours today, I’ll watch a movie, guilt free, at night.

    6. Habits are powerful because they create neurological cravings. It helps to add a new reward if you want to overcome your previous cravings.

    7. Only once your brain starts expecting a reward will the important rewiring takes place that will allow you to create new habits.

4. **The belief**: To change your habits, you need to change your underlying belief.

    8. **Ex**: You might feel like you’ll never be able to change the habit of studying late. This is not true. You can actually rewire your brain

    9. Joining a student community helps, either online or in real life.

    10. Trust your system. You have to feel happy and worry-free when you are resting.

&nbsp;  
**Weekly/Daily list:**

* Researchers showed that writing your daily list the **evening before** helps you accomplish them the next day. If you don’t write them down, they will take the valuable slots of memory.

* Plan your finishing time, this is as important as planning your working time.

* Work in the most important and most disliked task first, even if it’s only one pomodoro.

* Take notes about what works and what doesn’t.

* Have a backup plan for when you will still procrastinate.

 

&nbsp;  
**Focus on Process:**

You should realize that it’s perfectly normal to start a learning session with a negative feeling even if you like the subject. It’s how you handle those feelings that matters.

**Solution**: Focus on the process, not the product. The product is what triggers the pain that causes you to procrastinate. Instead of saying "I will solve this task today", put your best effort for a period of time continuously over the days.

&nbsp;  
**Memory:**

* Use your visual memory to remember things.  

    * **Ex**: Link a memorable picture to a formula.

* Images help you encapsulate a very hard to remember concept by tapping into visual areas with enhanced memory abilities.

* The more neural hooks you can build by evoking the senses the easier it will be for you to recall the concept.

* Keep repeating what you want to learn so that the metabolic toxins won’t suck away the neural patterns related to that memory. **Spaced repetition** is the key.

* **Flashcards** help. Consider using Anki.

* **Handwriting** helps you deeply convert what you are trying to learn into neural memory structures.

&nbsp;  
**Memory Techniques:**

* Create meaningful groups and abbreviations.

* To remember numbers, associate them to memorable events.

* Create mnemonic phrases from first letters of the words you want to remember.

* **Memory Palace Technique**: Use a familiar place (like the blueprint of your house) and associate visual images of things you want to remember with physical places.

    * This is not easy. You’ll be very slow at first. But with practice, you’ll get better.

    * The more you practice your "memory muscle" the easier you’ll remember.

##Week 4: Renaissance Learning and Unlocking Your Potential
---

&nbsp;  


**You should know:**

* Exercising is by far more effective than any drug to help you learn better. It helps new neurons survive.

* Learning doesn't always progress linearly and logically. Inevitably your brain will hit a knowledge-collapse sometimes. This usually means your brain is restructuring its understanding, building a more solid foundation.

* You learn complex concepts by trying to make sense out of the information you perceive. Not by having someone else telling it to you.

&nbsp;  
**Metaphors**

* Metaphors and analogies are very helpful, not only to memorize, but to also understand different concepts.

* It is often helpful to pretend that you are the concept you’re trying to understand.

&nbsp;  
**Intelligence:**

* Intelligence does matter. Being smart usually equate to having a large working memory (more than just four slots). 

* However, a super working memory can hold its thoughts so tightly that new thoughts won’t easily find a way into the brain. Such a tightly controlled attention could use an occasional breath of ADHD. You attention shifts even if you don’t want it to shift.

* **Deliberate practice** is what helps the average brain lift into the realm of those naturally gifted. Practicing certain mental patterns deepens your mind.

* Brilliant scientist like Ramón y Cajal, the father of neuroscience, or Charles Darwin, were not exceptionally gifted. The key to their success was **perseverance, taking responsibility for their learning and changing their thoughts.**

* Take pride in the qualities you excel at. Tune people out if they try to demean your efforts.

&nbsp;  
**Right hemisphere:**

* Helps us put our work into the big picture perspective and does reality checks.

* When you go through a homework or test questions and don’t go back to check your work, you’re acting like a person who’s refusing to use parts of his brain.

&nbsp;  
**Left hemisphere:**

* Interprets the world for us but with a tendency for rigidity, dogmatism and egocentricity.

* May lead to overconfidence. **Ex:** believing dismissively that your answers are corrects.

&nbsp;  
**Best practices:**

* Always step back and recheck to takes advantages of abilities of both-hemispheres interactions.

* Brainstorm and find focused people to analyze your work with. 

    * Your errors are sometimes easier to be found by others. 

    * Explaining yourself to others helps you understand more.

    * Studying in a team helps you catch what you missed, or what you can’t see.

* Don’t fool yourself. Don’t blindly believe in your intellectual abilities. Having a team can bring those projections down.

&nbsp;  
**Test Checklist:**

* Did you make a serious effort to understand the text? If you had a study guide, did you go through it?

* Did you attempt to outline every homework problem solution?

* Did you understand all your homework problems’ solutions? If not, did you ask for explanations?

* Did you work with classmates on homework problems? checked your solutions?

* Did you consult your instructor/teacher when you had a problem with something?

* Did you sleep well the night before the test?

&nbsp;  
**Test Taking Technique: Hard Start - Jump to easy:** (Try this strategy with homework problems first) 

1. Take a quick look at the test when it’s handed to you to get a sense of what it involves.

2. Start with the hardest problem. Pull yourself out if you get stuck for over 2 minutes. *Starting with a hard problem loads your focused mode first and then switches attention away from it. This allows the diffused mode to start its work.*

3. Turn next to an easy problem. Solves what you can, then move back to a hard one. *This allows the different part of your brain to work simultaneously on different thoughts.*

&nbsp;  
**Taking Test Tips:**

* Being Stressed before a test is normal. The body puts ups out chemicals when it’s under stress. How you interpret the body reaction to those chemicals makes all the difference. 

    * Shift your thinking from "I am afraid of this test" to “I am excited to do my best”.

* If you are stressed during a test, turn your attention to breathing. Relax, put your hand on your stomach and slowly draw some deep breaths. This will calm you down.

* Relax your brain on the last day before a test. Have a quick final look at the materials. Feeling guilty the last day is a natural reaction even if you prepared well. So relax.

* Good worry motivates you. Bad worry wastes your energy.

* Double check your answers. Look away, shift your attention, and then recheck.

My Grandma turned 90 last year. She sends an email to the family every night to let everyone know what she's up to. This was the end of her email tonight.[text]
I was going to sort some papers and discard, well, I started reading some letters and clippings, and the afternoon was gone and I still didn't pitch much.  Also, ended up being depressing as they were stuff with  square dancing and to think that we were all so young and there were three thousand at the convention.  So many of those friends are gone.  Where has the time gone.???Life was wonderful,  many happy memories but I miss those days and family and friends.  But I guess I was fortunate to have such wonderful memories of happy times.  My life was good.

I may sound like an old lady preaching, but you young folks live your life to the fullest,  because you can't come back and redo it.  So after all is said and done, you also will have happy memories to remember.

Love and Prayers,  mom

[text] Three Simple Ideas that Changed My Life
I've been wanting to write down these ideas for awhile in the hopes that someone else might find them useful. I know this sub has a tendency toward contrarianism, and I certainly do not intend these ideas to be "universal" - but just wanted to present these things that have personally worked for me and can maybe benefit someone else. If I slip into direct address and say "you" - I'm really just referring to myself. 

Long story short - about two years ago, I hated where I was in life. It was the recognition of these three ideas that kept me going and helped me to turn my life around. I should add that these ideas aren't original, but things that I've come across during that time and paraphrased one way or another.  

**1. The human being is meant to bear the burden of 24 hours -- no more, no less.** If you live in the future, you will get anxious; if you live in the past, you will get depressed. Twenty four hours is all that you have to live in. Give up all the other burdens to the universe, to god, to your cat, to whatever - but the burdens of the past are not yours. The burdens of the future aren't yours either. Let them go. The day is your material. It's what's in front of you, it's the only thing that you have the power to change or to shape or to use. It's your canvas. It's your material. So use it well. 

**2. Happiness is not something you can pursue - but instead the byproduct of doing the right thing.** We get so tripped up thinking that happiness is an end goal -- and then get frustrated when it slips through our fingers. Instead, focus on whatever the right thing is - and happiness will follow. Feel like shit at the end of the day? Maybe it's because you ate a tub of ice cream for dinner, forgot to call your mom back, blew off homework to play video games, etc. On the surface, those are all things that should make you "happy" - but I've found that when I'm feeling most depressed, its usually a factor of actions I either did or (more likely) did not do. If you're passively waiting for happiness to wash over you like a wave -- it's not going to happen.  Instead, take action, do whatever the "right thing" is, and that feeling of warmth and fulfillment will follow of its own accord. 

**3. The world's idea of success is total shit.** Don't get sucked into it. On television, on the street, when talking with friends or family - it seems like everyone confuses the concept of rewards with success itself. Whether it's money, fame, recognition, praise, sex, the rewards are not up to you -- they are all dependent on someone else. Instead, think of success as sustained effort of will. It begins and ends with YOU, and no one else. Think of any fantasy or goal you may have -- say you've always wanted to be a great artist. Imagine it. What does that look like? I guarantee you're thinking about palling around in paris with beautiful women and having your art work admired in galleries and being given the nobel prize - basically you're fantasizing about *having been* a great artist and not *actually making the art*. That way of thinking can totally mess you up because it once again puts the emphasis on passive recognition over active, sustained effort. The more you shift focus onto your own actions, the more you create sustained effort, and the more likely it is that the rewards will follow.

Lastly, as a bit of an addendum - **it's good to remember the difference between stopping and quitting.** This helps me when I'm feeling a bit lost or down on myself -- or during those times when I've just chucked these three ideas to the wind and sat on the couch all day instead. If you've ever strayed from what you feel you were supposed to do or who you were supposed to be - remember that everyone has to stop. Whatever it is we're doing, whatever our grand ambitions are in life, we stop. We have to stop. We have to take a piss, or go to bed, or go on vacation, or we have a kid and not have much time to ourselves etc. *But quitting is stopping without ever beginning again.* So as long as you're here, as long as you're alive and pulling air through your lungs, you can begin again. And if you begin again, then you haven't quit. So fucking begin again. 

Hope this helps someone out there.

[Discussion] Why do I feel incredibly motivated at night, plan out everything I'm going to do tomorrow, do nothing the next day and repeat forever?
And how can I escape this awful cycle?

EDIT: Mandatory "R.I.P my inbox" required. But seriously, I only expected like five replies so thanks a kabillion for replying and I hope anyone else who has the same issue can find some advice here. I'll try and make another edit with a summary of everything on this thread. Once again, thanks bros.
.
[Text] Time will pass whether you're using it or not. In five years, you can see the results of your hard work, or you can sit there wishing you had started five years ago.
One day, it will be 2024. You will still be you, except you won't be. Think back to the 2014 version of you. I bet you can barely recognize that person. Whether you're doing it intentionally or not, people change. You changed, and you will continue to change.

&#x200B;

We overestimate what we can do in one year and underestimate what we can do in five. It's so easy to think "This is my year!" or "In 2019, I'm going to do X", but a year really isn't all that much time. It's already April. Time flies. But you probably realized from thinking about your 2014 self that a lot changes in five years.

&#x200B;

In five years, you can be living a whole new life. You could have a family, a new career, live in a new country, or be that person you've always wanted to be who works out all the time and actually likes eating vegetables. All you need to do to get there is start working now. Start small, but start now.

&#x200B;

Don't get stuck thinking that you have tons of time. Remember how we're already into the fourth month of 2019? This year will be over before you know it. Get started. Small changes made every day for five years will amount to big things, and that time will pass whether you're using it or not.

Edit: btw, I have a blog where I post stuff like this all the time! [Here](https://www.lifebygrit.com/) is a link if you're interested.

[text] 10 years ago I was deeply depressed and afraid of life, today I'm halfway through a 2,189 mile hike through the Appalachian Mountains.
Hi everyone I'm writing to you from a tiny Dunkin Donuts in Maine while I wait for my bus. I'm halfway through my Appalachian Trail hike and am flipping up from WV to Maine where I will hike another 1,166 miles south back to WV. 

Here's a photo of me on Mcafee's knob. https://imgur.com/soqzJLh

**Edit:** Wanted to clarify - I'm not hiking to cure depression. I'm hiking because it's an awesome challenge and a great adventure and something I've wanted to do for a while. I dealt with most of my issues between 21-27. Now I'm reaping the rewards by actually living life and not a pale imitation of it.

I'm hiking solo and started in Georgia a little over three months ago. I've been reflecting over the last decade and the unexpected changes which the time has brought forth.

Ten years ago I was 19 years old and in my second year of college. That year I'd transferred from Missouri State to Mizzou in Columbia, MO. I had joined the Navy ROTC with big dreams of becoming a Navy officer and envisioned a bright future at Mizzou.

Very quickly I was overwhelmed. The stress of waking up at 5am for PT combined with the stress of my computer science classes quickly brought on depression. Which I now realize I went through cyclically during my teenage years through my late twenties.

That year I dropped out of ROTC, dropped out of my computer science classes, and changed my major to accounting. I spent all of my time locked in my dorm room playing World of Warcraft(the first expansion, the burning crusade had just come out). 

I made zero friends. Did nothing social. I was deeply depressed and had very little hope for the future. I'd just failed at basically everything I set out to do and I knew I was only digging a deeper hole by escaping into WoW.

I had a vision for what I wanted my life to be. I wanted to be fit. I wanted to be successful and happy. I wanted to be rid of this crippling depression and social anxiety. At 19 all of this seemed unattainable.

But something deep down wouldn't let me quit. The intention to improve was there. The episodes of depression would eventually abate. Each time I tried again. I reached for my dreams anew.

And I failed many more times than I succeeded. I lapsed into depression year after year with each major failure. Seemingly losing every inch of ground I had gained. But each time I would rise up faster. Come back stronger. More determined. With a better understanding of how to take care of myself.

With the perspective of a decade passed I can see now that every “negative” experience and every “failure” was actually an integral block in the foundation of the person that I am today.

My early failures lead directly to my later successes. I dropped out of ROTC after only 7 weeks but I have since successfully completed a six year contract as a US Army Infantryman and an NCO. I failed at computer science and hated my accounting jobs but now I have a successful online business that affords me the time to hike the AT.

It seems to me that fear is the enemy of life. You cannot live if you are consumed by fear. 10 years ago I was so full of fear. I was afraid of failure. Afraid of pain. I was afraid to even leave my room.

Now I'm hiking through 2,189 miles of wilderness solo. Doing things that would have been inconceivable to my younger self

With each step I take through the wild I am less fearful. I've hiked through thunderstorms that blew trees down around me. I've hiked past 300lb black bears and skirted angry rattlesnakes. 

This Appalachian Trail hike feels like a capstone course on a journey I started a decade ago. A journey to find myself. To face my demons. To conquer my fears.

As I step off into the unknown I am certain that our lives are our own. That we are not victims of circumstance. That the story of our life is ours to write. That we are infinitely powerful beings. But only if we so choose. 

Only if we take on the mantle of responsibility.

Only if we have the courage to stride forth into the unknown.

Only if we can discard our clinging for security and comfort.

Only then will we find abundant life. 

So I finish with this for all those who are lost, hurt, and alone: As long as you draw breath you have the power to change your life. You are more powerful than you could dream. You have everything within you to become the person that you've always wanted to be. Face your fears. Get uncomfortable. Embrace pain and failure. 

Your life is waiting. Go and claim it.

[Story] Free yourself from the social media
A month ago I relinquished all forms of social media (except Reddit). I grew weary of seeing the same videos, photos, and statuses of people I didn't know nor care for. After some time I realized all these different "social" platforms were negatively taking a toll on my mental health. It became less about staying in contact with friends and more about a pissing match. Display your best and hide your worst. It felt disingenuous and insincere. I also felt as though I wasn't living in the present anymore. Watching a concert I was attending through my phone to capture a video I'd never see again. It was consuming a colossal amount of time and pulling me from reality. Incessantly opening applications just to close them a few moments later. It was bizarre and reminiscent of a drug addiction. It needed to cease. I must say I feel wonderful now. It was like a weight was removed from my chest. I've noticed I now have a tremendous amount of free time. I've begun to rekindle lost hobbies and seem to have improved mental health. I know this may seem a bit silly to write about but I think it needs to be said. Hopefully this will inspire a few to try the same.

[Story] How I slipped into depression and alcoholism in my 40's, nearly lost everything, and how professional treatment helped me get back on track.
I'm 48, married, 3 kids, house, and all that.  Pretty average and normal guy.  All my life I have been incredibly upbeat and happy, creative, motivated, productive, and sometimes to a fault.  I was almost always unstoppable when I got started on something.

That all changed when I was about 42 or 43.  I'm not sure exactly when or why, but looking back I remember a few red flags.  I felt more emotional than usual some days.  I was more tired, craved alcohol and started drinking almost daily.  I started eating crap all the time.  I can't believe that I would drink 2-3 sodas a day - I *hate* the stuff.  

Depression set in, and while sometimes I thought about the whole meaning of life and suicide, usually I just wanted to sit around and do nothing.  Watch TV, mindlessly surf the web, play video games.  I had a long list of projects and books which all started to gather dust.  

I frequently read posts from /r/GetMotivated and bought books to help, hoping to find something, some words, some story, some trick to get me back on track, but I never did.  Nothing really clicked.

A few years into this I talked to my sister, who is 5 years older than me, and she said the exact same thing happened to her.  She offered no solution, however.  I did think it was interesting that we both felt this way, because it pointed to something biological.  

Finally, my wife told me to get help because I was getting worse.  My job was suffering, and for the first time in my life I was getting bad reviews.  I used to be the best member of the team!  What happened?  I begrudgingly talked to my doctor and we started trying different medications.  Maybe I had ADHD?  Maybe I had low testosterone?  All sorts of "what if's" and a new pill.  I don't remember all of the ones I tried, but nothing seemed to work.  

The short story is all of this took a toll on me in every way.  I've gained 25 pounds over 5 years, I work suffered more and more, and I finally got "laid off" (a nice way of firing me) from my job of 10 years that I could practically do with my eyes closed.  Then it took me almost a year to find a new job, and I wiped out our emergency fund plus an investment fund to stay above water.  

Then one day my doctor recommended another medication, and what did I have to lose, we switched *again*.  

Well, what do you know?  This one actually **worked**.  Within a week I felt like my younger self.  I had abundant energy, my mind felt clear and awake, and I could not believe how much stuff I had let go!  In just the past month I have tackled over 100 projects, [small](https://imgur.com/a/Yjo7I) and [large](https://imgur.com/a/QI2ls), and completed them.  The true measure is the fact that I *don't* surf the web every day, all day, and all night.  I spend 15 minutes before work, and then maybe 15 minutes after work ... maybe a little on the weekends, and that's it.  My computer is off.  It's unbelievable.  I can't remember the last time I played a video game.  But I am back to my old self, doing things, being productive.

A lot of stuff is just little things, like cleaning off my desk which has been a disaster area for years.  Some is big stuff - I cleaned out and organized our garage and parked both cars in there for the first time since we bought the house!  I have a small tech company that I run on the side, and within days I signed up a new client - the first one in over 7 years.  I also - thankfully - got a new job, and within the first month my managers are saying the same thing I used to hear from old managers - "That's *great*!  Keep plugging away!".  

In just the past week I have started working out.  I'm starting slow as to avoid injury, but as of yesterday I am taking two mile-long walks a day, doing push-ups (I did 10 yesterday which is a record for my fatass), pull-ups (a record 2 yesterday!), and am starting to do weight training again in a few days (gotta get a bench and bar set).  I miss it SO much, I don't know why I stopped.

I have also started keeping the kitchen clean, and I mean it's spotless.  Every time I come in, I clean, do whatever I want and clean again before I leave.  My wife used to complain how any time I made anything, it was like a tornado came through.  She started to complain again yesterday, out of habit, and came to a realization that made me smile.  She said:

> Ugh.  I really hate it when you ... wait, what am I saying?  You've been keeping the kitchen so clean, it's amazing, I don't know why I am complaining!  Carry on!

It was nice to see that her perception has changed.  At  first she expressed concern that I was experiencing a manic episode, but after a month she realized that this truly was who I am, who I was, the man she married.  She had been trying to protect me, in a way, and was trying to tell me to be careful that this is just temporary, but now she is sitting back and letting me be me again.

That's my story.  I am glad I worked with a professional, and while I normally would eschew medications, my doctor proved me wrong.  If you are struggling, and have not worked with a professional, maybe it's time you do.  I sure wish I had when this first set in.  I feel like I would have been five years further along, and in a better way.  And a whole lot less fat!

Thanks for taking the time to read this.

**Edit**: Ow, my inbox.  The medication is Mirtazapine - it's generic.  Of course, please consult a doctor before taking any medications, as it does has side effects and interactions with other meds.

**Edit**: I am on 30mg, but weigh close to 200 lbs.  Please talk to a professional before trying any medication!  Also, I am trying to reply to as many folks as I can, but had a busy day.  I got half-way through changing the power steering line on the minivan and the last fitting stripped, so I am going to tackle it tomorrow.  **If you're suicidal, please call the National Suicide hotline 1-800-273-8255**!

**Edit**: Several people pointed out I failed to discuss my alcoholism.  I could go into tremendous detail about that as well, but frankly it's a textbook case.  It tainted every aspect of my life, and has left a trail of wreckage as well.  I would binge drink upwards of 1/2 bottle of vodka almost every night of the week, if not more, and it crept up over almost 17 years.  It was only after I lost my job of 10 years, that I used to be a superstar at, and this whole spiral, did I realize the damage and have taken steps to recover.  If you or someone you know is alcoholic, please seek professional assistance.  

**Edit**: By the way, after I lost my job, I was on Medicaid which paid for my appt's and medications.  We also had EBT and TANF, plus some other assistance programs.  We had no other help.  I did not have any money, and in fact am $14k behind on my mortgage, $90k+ in debt, and filing bankruptcy.  My credit score was over 800 two years ago, and now ... [well](https://i.imgur.com/m28eIKZ.png).  I was "recommended" to "File bankruptcy". Sigh.  **If I can find help ... you can too.**

[Story] I was messy and disorganized two months ago. I got very motivated to keep my house clean after reading a Japanese book about tidying.
Part 2: https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/68ooeh/story_how_i_got_my_son_to_start_cleaning_his_room/

I've lived my whole life as a slob. I could never muster the willpower to clean when I could be doing something better, like work or video games. 

January 8th, I'm clicking /r/random over and over, and click  on /r/konmari. Hmm, something about cleaning like Japanese people. Kept clicking. 

The next day, I was going through my browsing history and pulled it up again. I read the FAQ.  Googled it. Torrented the audiobook from a private tracker. 

So there's this self - help book called 'the life changing magic of tidying up',  and I want you guys to know that reading it made me feel very pumped up about keeping my house clean, which was not something I thought was possible. 

The book told me to throw all the things away that don't make me happy. It said to touch each item and ask it if it brings me joy. 

I began with clothes. I threw all my underwear away, and all my socks. 80% of my long sleeve shirts, 90% of my shorts. I loved all my t-shirts and jeans, lol. I bought myself 4 pairs of merino wool socks, and 4 pairs of modal underwear. 

On this day I bought the book from Amazon. 

I had to work the next day. I build cars all day. I kept a notebook to write in during my downtime, because the next thing was gonna be rough : books. 

I hadn't read anything in about 3 years, preferring audiobooks to print so I can work. I put all my books on the floor, and spent a good 3 hours picking each up and putting it back down.  I had a bunch of art books I never used, hyperbole and a half, night vale, wheel of time, and a bunch of Richard Dawkins books signed by the author. 

I hadn't read any of it in years. They sound like prized possessions, but really, they brought me no happiness. I sold them all to half - priced books for $400.

I then took ALL of my papers and threw them on the floor. It took a whole day, but by the end I had reduced my paper volume by 95%. My shredder jammed. I threw it away, who needs a shredder when your job has a composter? My filing cabinet was empty. I donated it and kept my papers in a folder. 

I got the audiobook version of the 2nd book, listened to it over and over again while working. When I got home again, I tackled my CDs. 

I have an external hard drive, AND a bunch of high capacity flash drives! I threw every CD away except for labyrinth and my ghibli stuff. 

I tossed my sunscreen, it was expired anyway. Goodbye, empty shelves.  I had a bunch of uncomfortable blankets that were given to me as a gift  years ago. Donated. 

I didn't like any of my bookshelves, and I don't keep books on them anymore anyway. Those will be gone soon. 

Now, my house is so easy to clean, I barely even need motivation to do it. But there's no feeling of hopelessness, so I feel like cleaning way more often. 

How did you become a tidy person? 

Edit: Hey also check out 'how to win friends and influence people' by Dale Carnegie. The title sounded dumb, so I avoided it for 2 years after learning about it. I regret this very much.

Edit 2: everyone this is taking me a while, I promise I'll reply to everyone with questions, I need to work though

[Text] “Your value doesn't decrease based on someone's inability to see your worth.” - Unknown
Edit: I have been trying to discuss this quote with all of you, but it's hard to keep up. Here is maybe an explanation that helps with what I mean with this quote:
> 
> Being able to determine your own worth is also not something everyone can do. You can be too pessimistic, delusional or even optimistic about yourself. It really isn't possible to make a statement that's true in every situation. Also you have the whole "you judge people based on their actions and yourself on your intentions" thing going on. It really gets complicated, but that's also the problem with these quote posts (even though I have many of them). It's just one sentence trying to explain everyones situation which it can't. It's just a drive of motivation for myself and hopefully for others too.

[Story] It's Christmas Eve. I'm broken-hearted, but everything will be okay.
This is a long story, but I'll do my best to keep it short. 

I'm 26 and have been dating a woman for nearly two years now. Up until about two weeks ago we had been discussing life, marriage, children, etc. I thought everything was fine, and I did my best to always make her feel loved and supported. However, she has a rather abusive family (growing up in the South to an ultra-conservative atmosphere) so I've been understanding and patient, even talking her out of suicide on more than one occasion. She even started going to a counselor which I was very happy to hear. 
I loved her. I mean, I still do, but two weeks ago she broke up with me out of the blue for apparently no reason and gave me the "it's not you, it's me" line. Classic, right? I didn't eat for a week. Lost ten pounds because of it. I was destroyed. 

Today, I saw a picture of her and her family that her mother posted online...with her ex-fiancé (who cheated on her three years ago) in the photo beside her. Needless to say, I'm a bit devastated, because she claimed she could never go back to him after what he did. But his presence at their Christmas gathering means this has likely gone on longer than I care to admit. I feel betrayed and shattered by a woman I believed I could trust and give everything to, especially considering that she acted like nothing was abnormal up until the very second we broke up. 

All this to say to those who are feeling lonely or lost (maybe on the holidays more than usual): it will get better. I'm not feeling it yet, but we must move forward during hopeless times like these. Sure, I love her and will likely always love her to some extent, but she does not define who I am. I define who I am and deserve better. 

I want you to know that you are loved. By family. Friends. And if not by either of those, then by me. I know how it feels to be in pain, such pain that it seems like your chest will rip open. You and I will likely never meet, but I understand what it feels like to be in anguish and I love you. So hang in there, and try your best to find happiness in all that you do because only you can find happiness for yourself. 

Say a prayer for me, send good karma/vibes, or do whatever your ideologies or practices entail. I will do the same for you. Many blessings, and good luck to you all. 

tl;dr: Sadness, though it seems cold and deep, will not last forever. You are loved. Hang in there.  

Edit: Wow. I just woke up, and I'm blown away by all of the support. Thank you all so much for your kind words and wisdom. I've been reading them since I awoke, and it breaks my heart that so many people have gone or are going through what I am. However, it's also inspiring. It always helps to know that you are not alone. I'm not alone, and neither are you. I love each and every one of you. Thank you for taking the time to share your story. Many blessings to you all, and Merry Christmas.

[Discussion] Your self-control is your most important skill. Learn how to improve it.
Preface: I took all the material from an article titled [The Stanford Marshmallow Experiment: How Self-Control and Willpower Determine Your Success in Life](https://effectiviology.com/stanford-marshmallow-experiment-self-control-willpower/). If you want to read more about this topic with better formatting + sources, go there.

**Why willpower is important**

People’s ability to control yourself and delay gratification is one of the strongest predictors of success later in life, affecting factors such as their social competence, ability to deal with frustration, financial status, and physical and mental health.

**How our psychological self-control systems work**

The TL;DR version is that we use two systems when it comes to self-control:

* An impulsive **hot system**, which promotes detrimental behaviors such as fixating on rewards.

*  A rational **cool system**, which promotes positive behaviors such as successful self-distraction.

**How this relates to improving your self-control**

From the article:

> Based on this, we can say that overall, our self-control depends on our ability to inhibit the occurrence of “hot” behaviors, by utilizing “cool” strategies.

> This means that you want to avoid obsessing about the rewards, or fixating on the difficulty of resisting the temptation to enjoy them. Instead, as soon as you recognize yourself starting to fall into one of these negative thought patterns, you need to mentally “exit” it as quickly as possible.

> You can do this by distracting yourself, and by engaging in unrelated positive experiences. This can be anything from playing a game to reading a book, to talking with a friend. The more positive the experience, and the more it can distract you from the potential reward, the more it will help you exercise restraint and self-control.

> This may sound difficult to accomplish, but studies show that self-control training can be beneficial in the long term, and that you can strengthen your willpower through the regular practice of small acts of self-control. This is important, since it means that doing something such as reducing your snacking behavior can later help you exercise self-control in unrelated areas, such as pushing yourself at the gym, or fighting against your procrastination tendencies when it comes to doing work.

Again, full credit goes to: [The Stanford Marshmallow Experiment: How Self-Control and Willpower Determine Your Success in Life](https://effectiviology.com/stanford-marshmallow-experiment-self-control-willpower/), which also contains more useful information on the topic.

[Text] Be softer with you. You are a breathing thing, A memory to someone. Home to a life.
By Nayyirah Waheed 
.
[Text] Soon I will be gone forever, but that's okay as long as someone reads this
I am only 24 years old, yet I have actually already chosen my last tie. It’s [the one that I will wear on my funeral](http://i.imgur.com/Ln8Yyqf.jpg?1) a few months from now. It may not match my suit, but I think it’s perfect for the occasion. 

The cancer diagnosis came too late to give me at least a tenuous hope for a long life, but I realized that the most important thing about death is to ensure that you leave this world a little better than it was before you existed with your contributions . The way I’ve lived my life so far, my existence or more precisely the loss of it, will not matter because I have lived without doing anything impactful.

Before, there were so many things that occupied my mind.  When I learned how much time I had left, however, it became clear which things are really important. So, I am writing to you for a selfish reason. I want to give meaning to my life by sharing with you what I have realized:

* Don’t waste your time on work that you don’t enjoy.
It is obvious that you cannot succeed in something that you don’t like.
Patience, passion, and dedication come easily only when you love what you do.

* It’s stupid to be afraid of others’ opinions. Fear weakens and paralyzes you. If you let it, it can grow worse and worse every day until there is nothing left of you, but a shell of yourself. Listen to your inner voice and go with it. Some people may call you crazy, but some may even think you‘re a legend.

* Take control of your life
Take full responsibility for the things that happen to you. Limit bad habits and try to lead a healthier life. Find a sport that makes you happy. Most of all, don’t procrastinate. **Let your life be shaped by decisions you made, not by the ones you didn’t.**

* Appreciate the people around you
Your friends and relatives will always be an infinite source of strength and love. That is why you shouldn’t take them for granted. 

It is difficult for me to fully express my feelings about the importance of these simple realizations, but I hope that you will listen to someone who has experienced how valuable time is. 

I'm not upset because I understand that the last days of my life have become meaningful. I only regret that I will not be able to see a lot of cool stuff that should happen soon like the creation of AI, or Elon Musk’s next awesome project. I also hope that the war in Syria and Ukraine will end soon.

We care so much about the health and integrity of our body that until death, we don’t notice that the body is nothing more than a box - a parcel for delivering our personality, thoughts, beliefs and intentions to this world. If there is nothing in this box that can change the world, then it doesn’t matter if it disappears. I believe that we all have potential, but it also takes a lot of courage to realize it.  

You can float through a life created by circumstances, missing day after day, hour after hour. Or, you can fight for what you believe in and write the great story of your life. 
I hope you will make the right choice.

Leave a mark in this world. 
Have a meaningful life, whatever definition it has for you. Go towards it. The place we are leaving is a beautiful playground, where everything is possible. Yet, we are not here forever. Our life is a short spark in this beautiful little planet that flies with incredible speed to the endless darkness of the unknown universe. So, enjoy your time here with passion. Make it interesting. Make it count!

Thank you!

[Discussion] There's One Hundred Days left in 2018. If you're making your goals, keep going. If you're struggling, keep going. If you've just begun, keep going. If you start today, one hundred days will change your life.
In the last two days, I have been *blown the fuck away* by the responses this community has shared.  

I've seen some pretty loathsome things - people trying to demotivate myself and others from achieving their goals, disparaging me for potentially inspiring someone to harm themselves if they can't make those goals.

I've seen struggle and words of reinforcement. People who are going through all kinds of heart break and loss, people searching their souls for worth and identity, and those of you who've admitted to falling short of their own expectations

More than all of those combined, I've seen victories and new goals set.  'Victory,' to me, means you accomplished something, you're carrying on, or you've been invigorated with renewed energy to push forward.

To the demotivators, I'm so sorry you felt the need to try and drive the hopes and dreams of others away, especially on this thread. Sure, front page, visible to everyone, I must have been asking for it. Honestly, I took your words as reverse psychology, regardless of your intent. Communities like this carry on because we find our motivation from within - and your influence isn't a part of that. 

To the strugglers - don't listen to the detractors. Your efforts will pay off in the end, even if they need adjustment over time. Plan change, and they can be hard, but the goals can still be attained. No voice - supportive or not - should be louder than your internal mantra. You win because *you* want to. Everyone else can eat dust.

To the accomplished, or the nearly there - you don't need anything from me but an enthusiastic high five. You know what you're doing and you're succeeding. Bloody well done.

I'm so happy to have had a moment in the sunshine of your lives (or the gloomy clouds, depending on your outlook). You've impressed and inspired me well beyond my own expectations.

I want to put together a sub maybe called /r/One_Hundred_Days or /r/Keep_Going, but I know nothing about CCS or integrating any kind of bots people could use to track their efforts and create a wholesome community of positive support, with enough Mods that can deter the inevitable troll. If you want to do this with me, or without, please let me know. I strongly believe that community can succeed and be a great example to others.

Thank you, everyone, and especially the mods of /r/GetMotivated for keeping this place relatively free of the despairing.

Most of all, Keep Going

##Week 1: What is Learning?
---

&nbsp;  
**Brain Facts:**

* Cells of the nervous system are called neurons. Information from one neuron flows to another neuron across a synapse. Human brain has a million billion synapses.

* Your brain creates synapses whenever you learn something new. Sleeping helps "update" your brain cells. Literally.

&nbsp;  
**Why do we procrastinate (scientifically):**

**Problem:**

Learning a new thing or doing something you would rather not do can be stressing. This can cause anxiety at first. This activates the area associated with pain in the brain.

Your brain looks for a way to stop that negative feeling by switching your attention to something else more pleasant.

**Solution:**

The trick is to just start. Researchers discovered that not long after people start actually working out what they didn’t like, that neuro-discomfort disappeared. 

Remember that the better you get at something, the more enjoyable it can become.

Consider using the pomodoro technique.

&nbsp;  
**Learning hard and abstract things:**

The more abstract something is, the more important it is to practice to create and strengthen neural connections to bring the abstract ideas to reality for you.

**Ex**: You should practice a lot with the math vocabulary to understand it and recall it easier.
[∫∞e^x dx, k!(n−k)!]


&nbsp;  
**Summary of what I learnt:**

1. There are two modes of thinking:

    1. **Focused mode:** Concentrating on things that are usually familiar.

    2. **Diffused mode:** A relaxed mode of thinking "your thoughts are free to wander".

2. When you don’t desire doing/learning something, go through it and just start. The discomfort goes away and, in the long term, this will lead to satisfaction.

3. When you learn something new, make sure to take time to rest, then come back to it and recall what you learnt. 

    3. This is very important. Don’t cram information in one day. This leads to inefficient learning. It’s like building a wall without letting it dry.

    4. Revisiting and practicing what you learn is important. Research shows that **spaced repetition** (repeating things after few days) is the best way to build and strengthen the synaptic connections.

4. Sleep is very important. It clears the metabolic toxins from the brain after a day of "brain use". It is best to sleep directly after learning new things.

5. It was shown that exercising and/or being in a rich social environment helps your brain produce new neurons. Don’t lock yourself in your room. Stay active and spare time for exercise (including general physical activities) and friends daily.

##Week 2: Chunking
---

&nbsp;  

**Chunks:**

Pieces of information, neuroscientifically speaking, bond together through use and meaning. They can get bigger and more complex, but at the same time, they are single easy to access items that can fit into the slot of the working memory. 

* **Chunking** is the act of grouping concepts into compact packages of information that are easier for the mind to access.

* **Example**: If you understand and practice a math formula. You no longer will need to focus much to solve it like you did the first time. That’s because your "formula chunk" got so abstracted into your brain that it can only take one slot of your working memory to solve it.

&nbsp;  
**Turn off distractions**. You want to use all the four slots of your working memory when studying. Learning will be inefficient if some of those slots are connected to something else.

&nbsp;  
**You have to solve the problem yourself.** Just because you see it, or even understand it, doesn't mean that you will be able to solve it (**Illusion of competence**). It is always easier to look at the material, even if you think it’s easy, then doing it yourself.

&nbsp;  
**It gets easier.** When you think that a chapter or a book has too much information and that there’s no way to go through them all; just focus on whatever section you’re studying. You’ll find that once you put that first concept in your mental library, the following one will be easier.

This concept is called **Transfer**; a chunk you have mastered in one area can often help you much more easily learn other chunks of information in different areas.

&nbsp;  
**Master the major idea** and then start getting deeper. However, make sure not to get stuck in some details before having a general idea. Practice to help yourself gain mastery and sense of the big picture context. Try taking a "picture walk" before you dig through the material, this means, look briefly at the pictures, chapter titles, formulas used… before diving into details.

&nbsp;  
**Recall mentally** without looking at the material. This is proven more effective than to simply rereading. Reread only after you try to recall and write down what was in the material.

Consider recalling when you are in different places to become independent of the cues from any giving location. This will help you when taking a test in the class.

&nbsp;  
**Test yourself** to make sure you are actually learning and not fooling yourself into learning. Mistakes are a good thing. They allow you to catch illusions of competence. 

&nbsp;  
**Don’t always trust your initial intuition. Einstellung** problem (a German word for Mindset). An idea or a neural pattern you developed might prevent a new better idea from being found. Sometimes your initial intuition on what you need to be doing is misleading.You’ve to unlearn old ideas and approaches as you are learning new ones.

&nbsp;  
**Mix up the problems (Interleaving)** from different chapters. This is helpful to create connections between your chunks. It can make your learning a bit more difficult, but it helps you learn more deeply. Interleaving is very important. It is where you leave the world of practice and repetition, and begin thinking more independently.

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
**Don’ts:**

* Highlighting too much and creating maps are often ineffective without recalling.

* Repeating something you already learnt or know very well is **easy**. It can bring the **illusion of competence**; that you’ve mastered the full material when you actually just know the easy stuff. Balance your studies and focus on the more difficult (**deliberate practice**). This sets the difference between a good student and a great student.

* A big mistake is to blindly start working on an exercise without reading the textbook or attending the class. This is a recipe of sinking. It’s like randomly allowing a thought to pop off in the focus mode without paying attention to where the solution truly lies.

##Week 3: Procrastination and Memory
---

&nbsp;  

**Procrastination:**

* The routine, habitual responses your brain falls into when you try to do something hard or unpleasant. Focusing only on making the present moment feels better.

* Unlike procrastination which is easy to fall into, Willpower is hard to come by. It uses a lot of neural resources and you shouldn’t waste it on fending off procrastination except when really necessary. You actually don’t need to.

* The long-term effect of Procrastination can be dangerous. Putting your studies off leads to studying becoming even more painful. Procrastination is a habit that affects many areas of your life, if you improve in this area, many positive changes will unfold.

* Procrastination shares features with addiction. At first, it leads you to think that if you study too early you’ll forget the material. Then, when the class is ahead of you, it leads you to think that you are inadequate or that the subject is too hard.

* You want to avoid cramming which doesn’t build solid neural structures, by putting the same amount into your learning, and spacing it over a long period by starting earlier.

&nbsp;  
**First time learning something:**

* The first time you do something the deluge of information coming at you would make the job seem almost impossibly difficult. But, once you've chunked it, it will be simple. 

* At first, it's really hard, later it's easy. It becomes like a habit. **Ex:** Driving for the first time.

&nbsp;  
**Habits:**

* Neuro-scientifically speaking, chunking is related to habit.

* Habit is an energy saver. You don’t need to focus when performing different habitual tasks.

* Habits can be good or bad, brief or long.

&nbsp;  
**Habits Parts:**

1. **The cue**: The trigger that launches you into zombie mode (habitual routine).

    1. Recognize what launches you in zombie procrastination mode:

        1. Location. Time. Feelings. Reaction to people or events…

    2. Consider shutting your phone/internet for brief periods of time to prevent most cues.

2. **The routine**: Routine you do in reaction to the cue.

    3. You only need to use your willpower to change your reaction to the cues.

    4. Actively focus on rewiring your old habits.

        2. You need a plan. You need some willpower.

3. **The reward**: Habits exist because they reward us.

    5. Give yourself bigger rewards for bigger achievements. But after you finish them.

        3. **Ex**: If I study for 4 hours today, I’ll watch a movie, guilt free, at night.

    6. Habits are powerful because they create neurological cravings. It helps to add a new reward if you want to overcome your previous cravings.

    7. Only once your brain starts expecting a reward will the important rewiring takes place that will allow you to create new habits.

4. **The belief**: To change your habits, you need to change your underlying belief.

    8. **Ex**: You might feel like you’ll never be able to change the habit of studying late. This is not true. You can actually rewire your brain

    9. Joining a student community helps, either online or in real life.

    10. Trust your system. You have to feel happy and worry-free when you are resting.

&nbsp;  
**Weekly/Daily list:**

* Researchers showed that writing your daily list the **evening before** helps you accomplish them the next day. If you don’t write them down, they will take the valuable slots of memory.

* Plan your finishing time, this is as important as planning your working time.

* Work in the most important and most disliked task first, even if it’s only one pomodoro.

* Take notes about what works and what doesn’t.

* Have a backup plan for when you will still procrastinate.

 

&nbsp;  
**Focus on Process:**

You should realize that it’s perfectly normal to start a learning session with a negative feeling even if you like the subject. It’s how you handle those feelings that matters.

**Solution**: Focus on the process, not the product. The product is what triggers the pain that causes you to procrastinate. Instead of saying "I will solve this task today", put your best effort for a period of time continuously over the days.

&nbsp;  
**Memory:**

* Use your visual memory to remember things.  

    * **Ex**: Link a memorable picture to a formula.

* Images help you encapsulate a very hard to remember concept by tapping into visual areas with enhanced memory abilities.

* The more neural hooks you can build by evoking the senses the easier it will be for you to recall the concept.

* Keep repeating what you want to learn so that the metabolic toxins won’t suck away the neural patterns related to that memory. **Spaced repetition** is the key.

* **Flashcards** help. Consider using Anki.

* **Handwriting** helps you deeply convert what you are trying to learn into neural memory structures.

&nbsp;  
**Memory Techniques:**

* Create meaningful groups and abbreviations.

* To remember numbers, associate them to memorable events.

* Create mnemonic phrases from first letters of the words you want to remember.

* **Memory Palace Technique**: Use a familiar place (like the blueprint of your house) and associate visual images of things you want to remember with physical places.

    * This is not easy. You’ll be very slow at first. But with practice, you’ll get better.

    * The more you practice your "memory muscle" the easier you’ll remember.

##Week 4: Renaissance Learning and Unlocking Your Potential
---

&nbsp;  


**You should know:**

* Exercising is by far more effective than any drug to help you learn better. It helps new neurons survive.

* Learning doesn't always progress linearly and logically. Inevitably your brain will hit a knowledge-collapse sometimes. This usually means your brain is restructuring its understanding, building a more solid foundation.

* You learn complex concepts by trying to make sense out of the information you perceive. Not by having someone else telling it to you.

&nbsp;  
**Metaphors**

* Metaphors and analogies are very helpful, not only to memorize, but to also understand different concepts.

* It is often helpful to pretend that you are the concept you’re trying to understand.

&nbsp;  
**Intelligence:**

* Intelligence does matter. Being smart usually equate to having a large working memory (more than just four slots). 

* However, a super working memory can hold its thoughts so tightly that new thoughts won’t easily find a way into the brain. Such a tightly controlled attention could use an occasional breath of ADHD. You attention shifts even if you don’t want it to shift.

* **Deliberate practice** is what helps the average brain lift into the realm of those naturally gifted. Practicing certain mental patterns deepens your mind.

* Brilliant scientist like Ramón y Cajal, the father of neuroscience, or Charles Darwin, were not exceptionally gifted. The key to their success was **perseverance, taking responsibility for their learning and changing their thoughts.**

* Take pride in the qualities you excel at. Tune people out if they try to demean your efforts.

&nbsp;  
**Right hemisphere:**

* Helps us put our work into the big picture perspective and does reality checks.

* When you go through a homework or test questions and don’t go back to check your work, you’re acting like a person who’s refusing to use parts of his brain.

&nbsp;  
**Left hemisphere:**

* Interprets the world for us but with a tendency for rigidity, dogmatism and egocentricity.

* May lead to overconfidence. **Ex:** believing dismissively that your answers are corrects.

&nbsp;  
**Best practices:**

* Always step back and recheck to takes advantages of abilities of both-hemispheres interactions.

* Brainstorm and find focused people to analyze your work with. 

    * Your errors are sometimes easier to be found by others. 

    * Explaining yourself to others helps you understand more.

    * Studying in a team helps you catch what you missed, or what you can’t see.

* Don’t fool yourself. Don’t blindly believe in your intellectual abilities. Having a team can bring those projections down.

&nbsp;  
**Test Checklist:**

* Did you make a serious effort to understand the text? If you had a study guide, did you go through it?

* Did you attempt to outline every homework problem solution?

* Did you understand all your homework problems’ solutions? If not, did you ask for explanations?

* Did you work with classmates on homework problems? checked your solutions?

* Did you consult your instructor/teacher when you had a problem with something?

* Did you sleep well the night before the test?

&nbsp;  
**Test Taking Technique: Hard Start - Jump to easy:** (Try this strategy with homework problems first) 

1. Take a quick look at the test when it’s handed to you to get a sense of what it involves.

2. Start with the hardest problem. Pull yourself out if you get stuck for over 2 minutes. *Starting with a hard problem loads your focused mode first and then switches attention away from it. This allows the diffused mode to start its work.*

3. Turn next to an easy problem. Solves what you can, then move back to a hard one. *This allows the different part of your brain to work simultaneously on different thoughts.*

&nbsp;  
**Taking Test Tips:**

* Being Stressed before a test is normal. The body puts ups out chemicals when it’s under stress. How you interpret the body reaction to those chemicals makes all the difference. 

    * Shift your thinking from "I am afraid of this test" to “I am excited to do my best”.

* If you are stressed during a test, turn your attention to breathing. Relax, put your hand on your stomach and slowly draw some deep breaths. This will calm you down.

* Relax your brain on the last day before a test. Have a quick final look at the materials. Feeling guilty the last day is a natural reaction even if you prepared well. So relax.

* Good worry motivates you. Bad worry wastes your energy.

* Double check your answers. Look away, shift your attention, and then recheck.

My Grandma turned 90 last year. She sends an email to the family every night to let everyone know what she's up to. This was the end of her email tonight.[text]
I was going to sort some papers and discard, well, I started reading some letters and clippings, and the afternoon was gone and I still didn't pitch much.  Also, ended up being depressing as they were stuff with  square dancing and to think that we were all so young and there were three thousand at the convention.  So many of those friends are gone.  Where has the time gone.???Life was wonderful,  many happy memories but I miss those days and family and friends.  But I guess I was fortunate to have such wonderful memories of happy times.  My life was good.

I may sound like an old lady preaching, but you young folks live your life to the fullest,  because you can't come back and redo it.  So after all is said and done, you also will have happy memories to remember.

Love and Prayers,  mom

[text] Three Simple Ideas that Changed My Life
I've been wanting to write down these ideas for awhile in the hopes that someone else might find them useful. I know this sub has a tendency toward contrarianism, and I certainly do not intend these ideas to be "universal" - but just wanted to present these things that have personally worked for me and can maybe benefit someone else. If I slip into direct address and say "you" - I'm really just referring to myself. 

Long story short - about two years ago, I hated where I was in life. It was the recognition of these three ideas that kept me going and helped me to turn my life around. I should add that these ideas aren't original, but things that I've come across during that time and paraphrased one way or another.  

**1. The human being is meant to bear the burden of 24 hours -- no more, no less.** If you live in the future, you will get anxious; if you live in the past, you will get depressed. Twenty four hours is all that you have to live in. Give up all the other burdens to the universe, to god, to your cat, to whatever - but the burdens of the past are not yours. The burdens of the future aren't yours either. Let them go. The day is your material. It's what's in front of you, it's the only thing that you have the power to change or to shape or to use. It's your canvas. It's your material. So use it well. 

**2. Happiness is not something you can pursue - but instead the byproduct of doing the right thing.** We get so tripped up thinking that happiness is an end goal -- and then get frustrated when it slips through our fingers. Instead, focus on whatever the right thing is - and happiness will follow. Feel like shit at the end of the day? Maybe it's because you ate a tub of ice cream for dinner, forgot to call your mom back, blew off homework to play video games, etc. On the surface, those are all things that should make you "happy" - but I've found that when I'm feeling most depressed, its usually a factor of actions I either did or (more likely) did not do. If you're passively waiting for happiness to wash over you like a wave -- it's not going to happen.  Instead, take action, do whatever the "right thing" is, and that feeling of warmth and fulfillment will follow of its own accord. 

**3. The world's idea of success is total shit.** Don't get sucked into it. On television, on the street, when talking with friends or family - it seems like everyone confuses the concept of rewards with success itself. Whether it's money, fame, recognition, praise, sex, the rewards are not up to you -- they are all dependent on someone else. Instead, think of success as sustained effort of will. It begins and ends with YOU, and no one else. Think of any fantasy or goal you may have -- say you've always wanted to be a great artist. Imagine it. What does that look like? I guarantee you're thinking about palling around in paris with beautiful women and having your art work admired in galleries and being given the nobel prize - basically you're fantasizing about *having been* a great artist and not *actually making the art*. That way of thinking can totally mess you up because it once again puts the emphasis on passive recognition over active, sustained effort. The more you shift focus onto your own actions, the more you create sustained effort, and the more likely it is that the rewards will follow.

Lastly, as a bit of an addendum - **it's good to remember the difference between stopping and quitting.** This helps me when I'm feeling a bit lost or down on myself -- or during those times when I've just chucked these three ideas to the wind and sat on the couch all day instead. If you've ever strayed from what you feel you were supposed to do or who you were supposed to be - remember that everyone has to stop. Whatever it is we're doing, whatever our grand ambitions are in life, we stop. We have to stop. We have to take a piss, or go to bed, or go on vacation, or we have a kid and not have much time to ourselves etc. *But quitting is stopping without ever beginning again.* So as long as you're here, as long as you're alive and pulling air through your lungs, you can begin again. And if you begin again, then you haven't quit. So fucking begin again. 

Hope this helps someone out there.

[Discussion] Why do I feel incredibly motivated at night, plan out everything I'm going to do tomorrow, do nothing the next day and repeat forever?
And how can I escape this awful cycle?

EDIT: Mandatory "R.I.P my inbox" required. But seriously, I only expected like five replies so thanks a kabillion for replying and I hope anyone else who has the same issue can find some advice here.

[Text] Time will pass whether you're using it or not. In five years, you can see the results of your hard work, or you can sit there wishing you had started five years ago.
One day, it will be 2024. You will still be you, except you won't be. Think back to the 2014 version of you. I bet you can barely recognize that person. Whether you're doing it intentionally or not, people change. You changed, and you will continue to change.

&#x200B;

We overestimate what we can do in one year and underestimate what we can do in five. It's so easy to think "This is my year!" or "In 2019, I'm going to do X", but a year really isn't all that much time. It's already April. Time flies. But you probably realized from thinking about your 2014 self that a lot changes in five years.

&#x200B;

In five years, you can be living a whole new life. You could have a family, a new career, live in a new country, or be that person you've always wanted to be who works out all the time and actually likes eating vegetables. All you need to do to get there is start working now. Start small, but start now.

&#x200B;

Don't get stuck thinking that you have tons of time. Remember how we're already into the fourth month of 2019? This year will be over before you know it. Get started. Small changes made every day for five years will amount to big things, and that time will pass whether you're using it or not.

Edit: btw, I have a blog where I post stuff like this all the time! [Here](https://www.lifebygrit.com/) is a link if you're interested.

[text] 10 years ago I was deeply depressed and afraid of life, today I'm halfway through a 2,189 mile hike through the Appalachian Mountains.
Hi everyone I'm writing to you from a tiny Dunkin Donuts in Maine while I wait for my bus. I'm halfway through my Appalachian Trail hike and am flipping up from WV to Maine where I will hike another 1,166 miles south back to WV. 

Here's a photo of me on Mcafee's knob. https://imgur.com/soqzJLh

**Edit:** Wanted to clarify - I'm not hiking to cure depression. I'm hiking because it's an awesome challenge and a great adventure and something I've wanted to do for a while. I dealt with most of my issues between 21-27. Now I'm reaping the rewards by actually living life and not a pale imitation of it.

I'm hiking solo and started in Georgia a little over three months ago. I've been reflecting over the last decade and the unexpected changes which the time has brought forth.

Ten years ago I was 19 years old and in my second year of college. That year I'd transferred from Missouri State to Mizzou in Columbia, MO. I had joined the Navy ROTC with big dreams of becoming a Navy officer and envisioned a bright future at Mizzou.

Very quickly I was overwhelmed. The stress of waking up at 5am for PT combined with the stress of my computer science classes quickly brought on depression. Which I now realize I went through cyclically during my teenage years through my late twenties.

That year I dropped out of ROTC, dropped out of my computer science classes, and changed my major to accounting. I spent all of my time locked in my dorm room playing World of Warcraft(the first expansion, the burning crusade had just come out). 

I made zero friends. Did nothing social. I was deeply depressed and had very little hope for the future. I'd just failed at basically everything I set out to do and I knew I was only digging a deeper hole by escaping into WoW.

I had a vision for what I wanted my life to be. I wanted to be fit. I wanted to be successful and happy. I wanted to be rid of this crippling depression and social anxiety. At 19 all of this seemed unattainable.

But something deep down wouldn't let me quit. The intention to improve was there. The episodes of depression would eventually abate. Each time I tried again. I reached for my dreams anew.

And I failed many more times than I succeeded. I lapsed into depression year after year with each major failure. Seemingly losing every inch of ground I had gained. But each time I would rise up faster. Come back stronger. More determined. With a better understanding of how to take care of myself.

With the perspective of a decade passed I can see now that every “negative” experience and every “failure” was actually an integral block in the foundation of the person that I am today.

My early failures lead directly to my later successes. I dropped out of ROTC after only 7 weeks but I have since successfully completed a six year contract as a US Army Infantryman and an NCO. I failed at computer science and hated my accounting jobs but now I have a successful online business that affords me the time to hike the AT.

It seems to me that fear is the enemy of life. You cannot live if you are consumed by fear. 10 years ago I was so full of fear. I was afraid of failure. Afraid of pain. I was afraid to even leave my room.

Now I'm hiking through 2,189 miles of wilderness solo. Doing things that would have been inconceivable to my younger self

With each step I take through the wild I am less fearful. I've hiked through thunderstorms that blew trees down around me. I've hiked past 300lb black bears and skirted angry rattlesnakes. 

This Appalachian Trail hike feels like a capstone course on a journey I started a decade ago. A journey to find myself. To face my demons. To conquer my fears.

As I step off into the unknown I am certain that our lives are our own. That we are not victims of circumstance. That the story of our life is ours to write. That we are infinitely powerful beings. But only if we so choose. 

Only if we take on the mantle of responsibility.

Only if we have the courage to stride forth into the unknown.

Only if we can discard our clinging for security and comfort.

Only then will we find abundant life. 

So I finish with this for all those who are lost, hurt, and alone: As long as you draw breath you have the power to change your life. You are more powerful than you could dream. You have everything within you to become the person that you've always wanted to be. Face your fears. Get uncomfortable. Embrace pain and failure. 

Your life is waiting. Go and claim it.

[Story] Free yourself from the social media
A month ago I relinquished all forms of social media (except Reddit). I grew weary of seeing the same videos, photos, and statuses of people I didn't know nor care for. After some time I realized all these different "social" platforms were negatively taking a toll on my mental health. It became less about staying in contact with friends and more about a pissing match. Display your best and hide your worst. It felt disingenuous and insincere. I also felt as though I wasn't living in the present anymore. Watching a concert I was attending through my phone to capture a video I'd never see again. It was consuming a colossal amount of time and pulling me from reality. Incessantly opening applications just to close them a few moments later. It was bizarre and reminiscent of a drug addiction. It needed to cease. I must say I feel wonderful now. It was like a weight was removed from my chest. I've noticed I now have a tremendous amount of free time. I've begun to rekindle lost hobbies and seem to have improved mental health. I know this may seem a bit silly to write about but I think it needs to be said. Hopefully this will inspire a few to try the same.

[Story] How I slipped into depression and alcoholism in my 40's, nearly lost everything, and how professional treatment helped me get back on track.
I'm 48, married, 3 kids, house, and all that.  Pretty average and normal guy.  All my life I have been incredibly upbeat and happy, creative, motivated, productive, and sometimes to a fault.  I was almost always unstoppable when I got started on something.

That all changed when I was about 42 or 43.  I'm not sure exactly when or why, but looking back I remember a few red flags.  I felt more emotional than usual some days.  I was more tired, craved alcohol and started drinking almost daily.  I started eating crap all the time.  I can't believe that I would drink 2-3 sodas a day - I *hate* the stuff.  

Depression set in, and while sometimes I thought about the whole meaning of life and suicide, usually I just wanted to sit around and do nothing.  Watch TV, mindlessly surf the web, play video games.  I had a long list of projects and books which all started to gather dust.  

I frequently read posts from /r/GetMotivated and bought books to help, hoping to find something, some words, some story, some trick to get me back on track, but I never did.  Nothing really clicked.

A few years into this I talked to my sister, who is 5 years older than me, and she said the exact same thing happened to her.  She offered no solution, however.  I did think it was interesting that we both felt this way, because it pointed to something biological.  

Finally, my wife told me to get help because I was getting worse.  My job was suffering, and for the first time in my life I was getting bad reviews.  I used to be the best member of the team!  What happened?  I begrudgingly talked to my doctor and we started trying different medications.  Maybe I had ADHD?  Maybe I had low testosterone?  All sorts of "what if's" and a new pill.  I don't remember all of the ones I tried, but nothing seemed to work.  

The short story is all of this took a toll on me in every way.  I've gained 25 pounds over 5 years, I work suffered more and more, and I finally got "laid off" (a nice way of firing me) from my job of 10 years that I could practically do with my eyes closed.  Then it took me almost a year to find a new job, and I wiped out our emergency fund plus an investment fund to stay above water.  

Then one day my doctor recommended another medication, and what did I have to lose, we switched *again*.  

Well, what do you know?  This one actually **worked**.  Within a week I felt like my younger self.  I had abundant energy, my mind felt clear and awake, and I could not believe how much stuff I had let go!  In just the past month I have tackled over 100 projects, [small](https://imgur.com/a/Yjo7I) and [large](https://imgur.com/a/QI2ls), and completed them.  The true measure is the fact that I *don't* surf the web every day, all day, and all night.  I spend 15 minutes before work, and then maybe 15 minutes after work ... maybe a little on the weekends, and that's it.  My computer is off.  It's unbelievable.  I can't remember the last time I played a video game.  But I am back to my old self, doing things, being productive.

A lot of stuff is just little things, like cleaning off my desk which has been a disaster area for years.  Some is big stuff - I cleaned out and organized our garage and parked both cars in there for the first time since we bought the house!  I have a small tech company that I run on the side, and within days I signed up a new client - the first one in over 7 years.  I also - thankfully - got a new job, and within the first month my managers are saying the same thing I used to hear from old managers - "That's *great*!  Keep plugging away!".  

In just the past week I have started working out.  I'm starting slow as to avoid injury, but as of yesterday I am taking two mile-long walks a day, doing push-ups (I did 10 yesterday which is a record for my fatass), pull-ups (a record 2 yesterday!), and am starting to do weight training again in a few days (gotta get a bench and bar set).  I miss it SO much, I don't know why I stopped.

I have also started keeping the kitchen clean, and I mean it's spotless.  Every time I come in, I clean, do whatever I want and clean again before I leave.  My wife used to complain how any time I made anything, it was like a tornado came through.  She started to complain again yesterday, out of habit, and came to a realization that made me smile.  She said:

> Ugh.  I really hate it when you ... wait, what am I saying?  You've been keeping the kitchen so clean, it's amazing, I don't know why I am complaining!  Carry on!

It was nice to see that her perception has changed.  At  first she expressed concern that I was experiencing a manic episode, but after a month she realized that this truly was who I am, who I was, the man she married.  She had been trying to protect me, in a way, and was trying to tell me to be careful that this is just temporary, but now she is sitting back and letting me be me again.

That's my story.  I am glad I worked with a professional, and while I normally would eschew medications, my doctor proved me wrong.  If you are struggling, and have not worked with a professional, maybe it's time you do.  I sure wish I had when this first set in.  I feel like I would have been five years further along, and in a better way.  And a whole lot less fat!

Thanks for taking the time to read this.

**Edit**: Ow, my inbox.  The medication is Mirtazapine - it's generic.  Of course, please consult a doctor before taking any medications, as it does has side effects and interactions with other meds.

**Edit**: I am on 30mg, but weigh close to 200 lbs.  Please talk to a professional before trying any medication!  Also, I am trying to reply to as many folks as I can, but had a busy day.  I got half-way through changing the power steering line on the minivan and the last fitting stripped, so I am going to tackle it tomorrow.  **If you're suicidal, please call the National Suicide hotline 1-800-273-8255**!

**Edit**: Several people pointed out I failed to discuss my alcoholism.  I could go into tremendous detail about that as well, but frankly it's a textbook case.  It tainted every aspect of my life, and has left a trail of wreckage as well.  I would binge drink upwards of 1/2 bottle of vodka almost every night of the week, if not more, and it crept up over almost 17 years.  It was only after I lost my job of 10 years, that I used to be a superstar at, and this whole spiral, did I realize the damage and have taken steps to recover.  If you or someone you know is alcoholic, please seek professional assistance.  

**Edit**: By the way, after I lost my job, I was on Medicaid which paid for my appt's and medications.  We also had EBT and TANF, plus some other assistance programs.  We had no other help.  I did not have any money, and in fact am $14k behind on my mortgage, $90k+ in debt, and filing bankruptcy.  My credit score was over 800 two years ago, and now ... [well](https://i.imgur.com/m28eIKZ.png).  I was "recommended" to "File bankruptcy". Sigh.  **If I can find help ... you can too.**

[Story] I was messy and disorganized two months ago. I got very motivated to keep my house clean after reading a Japanese book about tidying.
Part 2: https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/68ooeh/story_how_i_got_my_son_to_start_cleaning_his_room/

I've lived my whole life as a slob. I could never muster the willpower to clean when I could be doing something better, like work or video games. 

January 8th, I'm clicking /r/random over and over, and click  on /r/konmari. Hmm, something about cleaning like Japanese people. Kept clicking. 

The next day, I was going through my browsing history and pulled it up again. I read the FAQ.  Googled it. Torrented the audiobook from a private tracker. 

So there's this self - help book called 'the life changing magic of tidying up',  and I want you guys to know that reading it made me feel very pumped up about keeping my house clean, which was not something I thought was possible. 

The book told me to throw all the things away that don't make me happy. It said to touch each item and ask it if it brings me joy. 

I began with clothes. I threw all my underwear away, and all my socks. 80% of my long sleeve shirts, 90% of my shorts. I loved all my t-shirts and jeans, lol. I bought myself 4 pairs of merino wool socks, and 4 pairs of modal underwear. 

On this day I bought the book from Amazon. 

I had to work the next day. I build cars all day. I kept a notebook to write in during my downtime, because the next thing was gonna be rough : books. 

I hadn't read anything in about 3 years, preferring audiobooks to print so I can work. I put all my books on the floor, and spent a good 3 hours picking each up and putting it back down.  I had a bunch of art books I never used, hyperbole and a half, night vale, wheel of time, and a bunch of Richard Dawkins books signed by the author. 

I hadn't read any of it in years. They sound like prized possessions, but really, they brought me no happiness. I sold them all to half - priced books for $400.

I then took ALL of my papers and threw them on the floor. It took a whole day, but by the end I had reduced my paper volume by 95%. My shredder jammed. I threw it away, who needs a shredder when your job has a composter? My filing cabinet was empty. I donated it and kept my papers in a folder. 

I got the audiobook version of the 2nd book, listened to it over and over again while working. When I got home again, I tackled my CDs. 

I have an external hard drive, AND a bunch of high capacity flash drives! I threw every CD away except for labyrinth and my ghibli stuff. 

I tossed my sunscreen, it was expired anyway. Goodbye, empty shelves.  I had a bunch of uncomfortable blankets that were given to me as a gift  years ago. Donated. 

I didn't like any of my bookshelves, and I don't keep books on them anymore anyway. Those will be gone soon. 

Now, my house is so easy to clean, I barely even need motivation to do it. But there's no feeling of hopelessness, so I feel like cleaning way more often. 

How did you become a tidy person? 

Edit: Hey also check out 'how to win friends and influence people' by Dale Carnegie. The title sounded dumb, so I avoided it for 2 years after learning about it. I regret this very much.

Edit 2: everyone this is taking me a while, I promise I'll reply to everyone with questions, I need to work though

[Tool] I made a flowchart to control my mind.
What this [flowchart](http://i.imgur.com/qvgUU4S.jpg?1) tries to achieve: By making positive feedback loops a habit it reaches into your pessimistic/lazy subconsciousness and reprograms it into an optimistic/adventurous one. It has helped me a great deal for over a year now.

[Text] “Your value doesn't decrease based on someone's inability to see your worth.” - Unknown
Edit: I have been trying to discuss this quote with all of you, but it's hard to keep up. Here is maybe an explanation that helps with what I mean with this quote:
> 
> Being able to determine your own worth is also not something everyone can do. You can be too pessimistic, delusional or even optimistic about yourself. It really isn't possible to make a statement that's true in every situation. Also you have the whole "you judge people based on their actions and yourself on your intentions" thing going on. It really gets complicated, but that's also the problem with these quote posts (even though I have many of them). It's just one sentence trying to explain everyones situation which it can't. It's just a drive of motivation for myself and hopefully for others too.

[Story] It's Christmas Eve. I'm broken-hearted, but everything will be okay.
This is a long story, but I'll do my best to keep it short. 

I'm 26 and have been dating a woman for nearly two years now. Up until about two weeks ago we had been discussing life, marriage, children, etc. I thought everything was fine, and I did my best to always make her feel loved and supported. However, she has a rather abusive family (growing up in the South to an ultra-conservative atmosphere) so I've been understanding and patient, even talking her out of suicide on more than one occasion. She even started going to a counselor which I was very happy to hear. 
I loved her. I mean, I still do, but two weeks ago she broke up with me out of the blue for apparently no reason and gave me the "it's not you, it's me" line. Classic, right? I didn't eat for a week. Lost ten pounds because of it. I was destroyed. 

Today, I saw a picture of her and her family that her mother posted online...with her ex-fiancé (who cheated on her three years ago) in the photo beside her. Needless to say, I'm a bit devastated, because she claimed she could never go back to him after what he did. But his presence at their Christmas gathering means this has likely gone on longer than I care to admit. I feel betrayed and shattered by a woman I believed I could trust and give everything to, especially considering that she acted like nothing was abnormal up until the very second we broke up. 

All this to say to those who are feeling lonely or lost (maybe on the holidays more than usual): it will get better. I'm not feeling it yet, but we must move forward during hopeless times like these. Sure, I love her and will likely always love her to some extent, but she does not define who I am. I define who I am and deserve better. 

I want you to know that you are loved. By family. Friends. And if not by either of those, then by me. I know how it feels to be in pain, such pain that it seems like your chest will rip open. You and I will likely never meet, but I understand what it feels like to be in anguish and I love you. So hang in there, and try your best to find happiness in all that you do because only you can find happiness for yourself. 

Say a prayer for me, send good karma/vibes, or do whatever your ideologies or practices entail. I will do the same for you. Many blessings, and good luck to you all. 

tl;dr: Sadness, though it seems cold and deep, will not last forever. You are loved. Hang in there.  

Edit: Wow. I just woke up, and I'm blown away by all of the support. Thank you all so much for your kind words and wisdom. I've been reading them since I awoke, and it breaks my heart that so many people have gone or are going through what I am. However, it's also inspiring. It always helps to know that you are not alone. I'm not alone, and neither are you. I love each and every one of you. Thank you for taking the time to share your story. Many blessings to you all, and Merry Christmas.

[Discussion] Your self-control is your most important skill. Learn how to improve it.
Preface: I took all the material from an article titled [The Stanford Marshmallow Experiment: How Self-Control and Willpower Determine Your Success in Life](https://effectiviology.com/stanford-marshmallow-experiment-self-control-willpower/). If you want to read more about this topic with better formatting + sources, go there.

**Why willpower is important**

People’s ability to control yourself and delay gratification is one of the strongest predictors of success later in life, affecting factors such as their social competence, ability to deal with frustration, financial status, and physical and mental health.

**How our psychological self-control systems work**

The TL;DR version is that we use two systems when it comes to self-control:

* An impulsive **hot system**, which promotes detrimental behaviors such as fixating on rewards.

*  A rational **cool system**, which promotes positive behaviors such as successful self-distraction.

**How this relates to improving your self-control**

From the article:

> Based on this, we can say that overall, our self-control depends on our ability to inhibit the occurrence of “hot” behaviors, by utilizing “cool” strategies.

> This means that you want to avoid obsessing about the rewards, or fixating on the difficulty of resisting the temptation to enjoy them. Instead, as soon as you recognize yourself starting to fall into one of these negative thought patterns, you need to mentally “exit” it as quickly as possible.

> You can do this by distracting yourself, and by engaging in unrelated positive experiences. This can be anything from playing a game to reading a book, to talking with a friend. The more positive the experience, and the more it can distract you from the potential reward, the more it will help you exercise restraint and self-control.

> This may sound difficult to accomplish, but studies show that self-control training can be beneficial in the long term, and that you can strengthen your willpower through the regular practice of small acts of self-control. This is important, since it means that doing something such as reducing your snacking behavior can later help you exercise self-control in unrelated areas, such as pushing yourself at the gym, or fighting against your procrastination tendencies when it comes to doing work.
