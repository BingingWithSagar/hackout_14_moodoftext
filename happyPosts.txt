I recently started taking antidepressants and for the first time in 2 years I didn't fantasize about committing suicide today. I have a long way to go still, but this is a great start.
awww, thank you to whoever gave me gold! 


I'm trying to respond to everyone because I love you all for taking the time to comment.

I GET MY PHD TODAY! It’s been 4 years of really hard work and I almost quit several times. I’m excited to finally cross the finish line in about 4 hours!
EDIT: SO I WALK INTO MY OFFICE FOR THE DEFENSE AND MY WIFE IS HERE TO SURPRISE ME!!!! LET'S GO!!!! ONE MORE HOUR!

Edit Edit: OMG! This is be far my most upvoted post. Okay...first: I PASSED! You can call me Doctor! Second, my inbox is blown up; I will get back to EVERY SINGLE ONE OF YOU eventually, but please give me time! 

Edit Edit Edit: I'd like to add one more thing: many people have commented about wanting to quit something meaningful to them. This is a very normal experience to have. I almost quit my program at least 10 times in the first year because I did not believe I could do it. Just know that you can do it, but it is going to require some pains along the way. Anyone is welcome to PM me ANY TIME if they need someone for moral support.

Thanks for the support, and have a great day!

6 months clean from heroin today. A better life is possible!
I posted something in this sub a little less than 6 months ago after being clean for 2 weeks (I deleted the post for unrelated reasons) and while I got a lot of support I also got a lot of crap because it was "only two weeks, come back when you have actually achieved something".  Well, [here I am](http://imgur.com/gallery/ZDd7cMS), 6 months later, still clean, recently engaged, just got into a computer programming program, and have never been happier.  I just resolved my legal issues last week, actually have a savings of more than $2K, am rebuilding relationships with my family members and have nothing but optimism and hope for the future I never bothered to think about before.

Just wanted to use today to send out a PSA to anyone struggling with addiction - it can and DOES get better.  I am here for anyone that needs support. 

♥️

Edit:  I honestly hate these types of edits but holy shit I worked a double yesterday and just woke up to this... You guys are amazing.  Thank you from the bottom of my heart.

I’m listening to my boyfriend playing piano in the other room while I get ready this morning and the sound of his voice and sweet music is making my heart soar to heaven and back. This is the man I want to marry.
Edit: Guys I’m blown away from the feedback. I wasn’t expecting this to get as much love as it did. I think it just goes to show that happiness can be simple and doesn’t require any extravagant justifications for sharing your feelings. r/happy is such a great community.

My daughter turned 21 in October, we live in a big party/ college town, she's graduated with her own place, and yet she chose to spend NYE with me and her stepdad and her 3 goofy little sisters, watching Wizard of Oz and drinking copious amounts of non alcoholic sparkling cider.
I'm so happy seeing her cuddled up in her old bunk bed this morning, we did something right huh? She still wants to be around us lol. 
.
The love of my life, mother of my child, fiancee and most of all my best friend is 2 years sober today! Send some good vibes. I would like to show her that even strangers would be proud!
She was on opiates/heroin really hard but i loved her even then and just hoped she could over come it.  She did and we got togethor and have a beautiful 5 month old daughter. Anyone out there using you can beat that *%#!. 
.
I've made it 24 months without any alcohol! I'm so happy right now!
I was a mess for two decades, booze, coke, just whatever. I have now made it two years without a drink or any coke. I'm so happy right now. I was able to go back to school and I went from a 36 waist to a 30. I later gave up sodas and energy drinks, but alcohol was the tough one. Two years!!!
.
I'm in love with my girlfriend
She's asleep right now next to me. My phone took a poop so she said that I could use hers so I thought I'd make a post like this. You don't have to upvote I'm just posting it just for the sake of her finding it one day. 
.
I'm a young producer struggling to get people to listen to my music. Today, I woke up with an email telling me my last song was picked up by a local radio. Not much but it made my day!
edit: Wow, I'm so happy with all the amazing comments! You're making my day even more!

The song is called Restart (it's about erasing it all and starting from scratch). Here's the [YT link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3-dLzHz4jU)! (I'll remove the link if it's not allowed, mods please just let me know!)

edit 2: And to top if all, GOLD? What's happening today? Thank you SO MUCH!

edit 3: I'm reading all of your messages and it really makes this day special! Now I understand why this sub is called r/happy!

My mother is cancer free!
We found out she had uterine cancer last week, and they scheduled her for a hysterectomy immediately. She had surgery this morning, and it went great. Minimum blood loss, no sign of cancer. I'm so relieved I can't even tell you. Best day of my life.
.
This morning I had a epiphany, I made it. Despite all the odds I have a beautiful family, a successful career, and I live in paradise. I am happy.
I make the joke that I was drop kicked into this world. Short story I grew up in an abusive home environment and it wouldn’t have surprised anyone if I had just taken the path of least resistance and not gone to college, shacked up with an abusive partner and had five kids. There are days I still feel like I’m a scared little kid. 

But today something clicked, it sounds silly but Coldplay’s song ‘paradise’ came on the radio and I actually listened to the lyrics and thought, holy crap that was me. When I was scared as a kid I would curl up in my bed and dream of living some where close to a tropical beach with a hot dude that I loved.... far away from all the stuff I had to deal with then. Then it hit me, I do. I made that happen. I live in Hawaii, I’m married to a man I truly love, we have a beautiful son, and I am doing well in my career. I am happy. I am allowed to be happy. 
.
The woman I'm secretly in love with just admitted to me tonight that she loves me. Never been so happy in my life.
We're not even dating.  We've had crushes on each other for a while now.  I know a lot of people will think it's infatuation but believe me it's not! My heart hasn't stopped pounding all night!

Someone in this subreddit stole a pic of me and my son and is pretending it's them
**Very** weird and hilarious, but just in case you're interested in seeing the rest of the pictures I initially posted, here ya go:

Yesterday, wife got back results telling her she's cancer free. Youngest Child graduated from Junior High today. Eldest graduates from High School tomorrow.
As a husband and dad, this has been one hell of a week.

EDIT: Pizza and Cake were had by all.  I had beer.  It was good.  Thanks for all the well wishes guys!
.
I’ve wanted to be a college professor for 6 years now, and I just finished teaching the first day of my first college course!
It went great! My jokes got laughs, nobody tried to leave early, they responded to questions, and my nerves stayed in check the whole time. I’ve been working towards this for years and it feels great to be off to an amazing start!
.
I invited 20 people to my birthday party. They all came.
1.5 years ago, my daughter was 18 months old and I was lonely. I invited a bunch of friends over for a party, old and new, and watched as they all canceled on me. No one came. Legitimate excuses some, but I felt low priority. 

Saturday, everyone came. I have come so far in building community and investing in mom friends and my church. People came, had fun, and enjoyed themselves. I have a community! It has been a long, lonely 5 years since I moved with my husband to the East Coast. We are finally feeling at home.

OMG! Just got a call from my boss and received an UNEXPECTED RAISE! I'm now at 18.00 from 16.50. They said they appreciated my performance and wanted to show it. I'M FREAKING OUT RIGHT NOW
I work from home and I got a call this morning randomly from my boss. I saw it ring and thought to myself... oh shit, what did I do? ENDED UP BEING A SURPRISE RAISE!

This literally changes my life drastically!! This is a ton of extra disposable income each month!!! I can pay off my debts faster now while paying my regular bills.

I'm just so fucking happy right now and I had to tell somebody!  i wasn't expecting this AT ALL, it came out of nowhere and I am freaking out.

EDIT: Thank you so much everybody for the kind words!

I've suffered from social anxiety my whole life. Today I just crushed my first networking event.
My whole life I've been shy and have had a hard time meeting people. Today I went to a networking event for local artists and I talked to over 20 different individuals at the event. I even got a few who are interested in working with me.

I never thought this could happen but somehow I fucking did it and I'm still in awe right now.
.
As I was snuggling up next to him tonight my bf took in and let go a deep breath and said, “I love my life”.
I have never felt so content in my whole life.  I’m trying to treasure this moment in time.
.
I went to visit my dad at work, thinking he would just be happy to see me. But I soon realized that such a small gesture could mean so much. He was waiting at the bus stop for me when I arrived, and couldn't wait to show me around. He stayed an extra hour at work so he could spend an hour with me.
It meant so much to me to see how excited he was. It may seem insignificant, but we've had a stressful few years due to house break ins and my dad working in a highly stressful job in the country we lived in before. He also was not working in a safe environment or area and it took a toll on all of us.

We have just all moved to a new country. I'm an adult now, but I moved too to be closer to my family. However, I haven't been home for a few months due to work.  My dad finally found a new job position, after months of searching, and this is his new 'thing'. I thought just popping in would make him happy. 

But it made my day to realize how a small gesture meant so much. He stayed an hour overtime just so that I could come visit and he could spend time with me during a highly demanding and busy day. And his excitement to show me everything he was doing was so clear. He took me around the whole building and introduced me to everyone.

It is so important to remember how much such small things mean to our 'family' - be it guardians, those who have loved and cared for us, or parents and grandparents.

Updated post: 
I did not expect to log online and see so many upvotes and heartwarming comments. I hadn't even considered that this post may be noticed much - I just wanted to share something that made my day and it seems alot of people find some happiness in small things. This community really does reflect the humanity ever present around the world. I appreciate all the support and thoughtful words. Thank you to everyone for sharing some love here and caring about a stranger's post, or finding some meaning in it,  and to the kind soul who gave me a silver.  

To those who commented saying that they do not have the same relationship with their family, it does not mean that small gestures can't make someone else's day. There are many people who care about you. Whether they know you, or are yet to meet you. I suppose the message should be that we never know just how much a small gesture might mean to any person.
